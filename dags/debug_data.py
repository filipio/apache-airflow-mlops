When I saw they would be showing infamous eggs of the House of Faberge from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (VMFA), I knew I had to go!\n\nTucked away near the gelateria and the garden, the Gallery is pretty much hidden from view. It's what real estate agents would call \"cozy\" or \"charming\" - basically any euphemism for small.\n\nThat being said, you can still see wonderful art at a gallery of any size, so why the two *s you ask? Let me tell you:\n\n* pricing for this, while relatively inexpensive for a Las Vegas attraction, is completely over the top. For the space and the amount of art you can fit in there, it is a bit much.\n* it's not kid friendly at all. Seriously, don't bring them.\n* the security is not trained properly for the show. When the curating and design teams collaborate for exhibitions, there is a definite flow. That means visitors should view the art in a certain sequence, whether it be by historical period or cultural significance (this is how audio guides are usually developed). When I arrived in the gallery I could not tell where to start, and security was certainly not helpful. I was told to \"just look around\" and \"do whatever.\" \n\nAt such a *fine* institution, I find the lack of knowledge and respect for the art appalling.","date":"2015-04-15 05:21:16"}

My 3 year old son needed a haircut this past summer and the lure of the $7 kids cut signs got me in the door. We had to wait a few minutes as both stylists were working on people. The decor in this place is total garbage. It is so tacky. The sofa they had at the time was a pleather sofa with giant holes in it. And my son noticed ants crawling all over the floor and the furniture. It was disgusting and I should have walked out then. Actually, I should have turned around and walked out upon entering but I didn't. So the older black male stylist finishes the haircut he was doing and it's our turn. I tell him I want a #2 clipper around the back and sides and then hand cut the top into a standard boys cut. Really freaking simple, right? WRONG! Rather than use the clippers and go up to actually cut the hair, he went down. Using it moving downward doesn't cut hair, it just rubs against it. How does this man who has an alleged cosmetology license not know how to use a set of freaking clippers??? I realized almost immediately that he had no idea what he was doing. No idea at all. After about 10 minutes of watching this guy stumble through it, I said \"you know what? That's fine.\", paid and left. All I wanted to do was get out of that scummy joint and take my son to a real haircut place.\n\nBottom line: DO NOT GO HERE. RUN THE OTHER WAY!!!!!","date":"2013-12-07 03:16:52"}

We were not disappointed.\n\nI am a bit of an amateur chef myself and consider my palate to be fairly sophisticated when it comes to all kinds of South Asian cuisine. This is not authentic Indian food - we don't have rice and salad bowls - but it is good, wholesome, high quality Indian food.\n\nI ordered a bowl of rice, yellow daal and the koftas (meatballs). The daal was perfect, the way daal should be cooked. The koftas were a little bland for my taste, but otherwise not bad...soft and the right texture. Paired with the many sauces and onions and the whole dish was wholesome and rich and very filling. My friend ordered the biryani, which, while not bad, still isn't the way real biryani should be, and I come from a city known for its biryani - but then I still haven't found a single place in America that makes biryani the way they do it back home.\n\nThe ambiance is good and there's plenty of room to sit. The line moves quickly and at most you'll face a 10-15 min wait on a crowded day. The only issue I had was with the music - being a designer, it bothers me that the music selection to go with such great interiors  could have been better...I would expect Bollywood classics or Indian classical fusion instead of the usual loud pop music.\n\nTldr: if you're looking for authentically prepared and presented Indian food you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for high quality Indian-American food, this is a great place to get it. Will be coming back to try their tikka masala and chicken next.\n\nUpdate: went there again with a bunch of friends and tried their chicken tikka masala and pav bhaji. This is hands down the best Indian place in Pittsburgh - the bhaji is to die for. Make sure you sprinkle lemon on top and have the pav with mango chutney.","date":"2018-02-01 19:15:00"}

I just came back from Vegas this morning and a truly truly horrible experience.  I only went out there for a concert and the concert and this restaurant were the best parts of my trip.  I went in here accidentally, meaning, i had no clue it was Bobby Flay's restaurant. I was hungry and Caesars Palace was a across from where I was staying and all the restaurants in my hotel were packed and had lines, I walked right in with no waiting. (I will assume now that since its Bobby's place this place can get crowded so I feel the need to note this was a Sunday about 11:45am) Once inside Caesars Palace, I went to the first restaurant I saw, which was this one.  I realized mid-meal it was his restaurant when the waiter at the table next to me was explaining to the recently seated couple that \"Mr Flay likes a little spice so beware all of our dishes have a little kick\" (they were an older couple). I know i'm slow after he said that, that's when i realized why they had his cookbooks in the front. :)  (but like i said had a horrible trip so i wasn't even looking for things like this) anyway onto the food.\n\nFOOD: fantastic.  I went on sunday and i got the eggs and aged striploin tortilla (fancy name for steak and eggs) and  it was yummy.  It came with all this spices of sorts (well they werent spices). I am not really sure how to describe it, more like the consistency of salsa's but they werent salsa's, at any rate it was really good mix with the eggs.  I had a side of home fries which were a little burnt but oh well.  The steak was very good, very flavored, moist and tender. Overall very good. Had a cappuccino too, also very good. I wish i had tried the crabcake's but i knew i wasnt going to eat all that. waiters were awesome, just the right amount of attentiveness. (I personally hate when waiters\/waitresses, come back every 5 minutes, is everything ok is everything ok...sheesh can i enjoy my meal?) \n\nAnyway like i said, i had a horrible experience in vegas and this and the concert i went to see were the best parts about my trip, very glad i blessed up on this place.\n\nP.S.  Take notice, i have never eaten in a celebrity chef's restaurant and noticed that there were no salt and pepper shakers on any table.  ha just a fun tidbit, i thought that was funny and very interesting, almost as if the chef is subtly saying \"you will not mess up my dish with your spices\"","date":"2009-10-13 09:50:48"}

Maybe because it's an over-the-counter style place, but it would have been nice to be walked through their ordering process and menu.\n\nPRICE: Average. Depends on the size of pizza you order.The small pizza ($7-9.50) is filling for one. Large size pizza ($13-18.50) is good for sharing... or one VERY hungry person.  Pasta portions are very generous for the price tag ($9-14)\n\n\nFOOD: My friends and I were here for the first time, and we thought it was a pizza place so we all ordered pizza.

Oh, how things have changed.\n\nThere are some goods, however.  If you are a conventioneer, you have instant and direct walking access to the main convention center.  But don't think about parking here for said conventions.  $30 a day for parking, Hilton?  Seriously?  That's robbery.  And greed.\n\nThe biggest disappointment is the killing off of Star Trek: The Experience over two years ago.  Despite this place being off-Strip, I made it a point to go here because they had such a fun and unique attraction here.  It would be one thing if they had something in mind to replace it, but either poor planning or the economy.... It's dead, Jim. \n\nThe \"Space Lounge\" is still there.  An entire casino area with a heavy sci-fi theme to it.  Except there's no casino here.  It's a huge space themed area with a ghost town bar, no slots, a few couches, a makeshift stage, beer signs, and a few remnants of Star Trek themes.  All of this space, and nothing.  No life to it.  Couches and beer signs only make the emptiness and waste of the area seem more empty and pathetic.\n\nWith their main draw gone, what has replaced it as the headliner?  Benihana's.  Nothing wrong with the restaurant, but it's hardly unique or exclusive, even in Vegas.  The Hilton has a Pizza Hut Express here too.  Maybe they should promote that as their \"big draw\" on the marquee as well.  A huge Benihana sign covers up the old entrance to Star Trek.  With couches pushed in front of the entryway.  Again, just sad, and I'll be a big man in saying that they kind of broke my heart getting rid of one of my most beloved hang-outs here.\n\nThe arcade is dead as well.  Another blanketed off space that sits and collects dust.  Again, with two-plus years, no suitable replacement has been found for anything in this section.  A few shops that fluctuate, but that's it.  This is a lot of dead space to go unused.  \n\nThere's also the issue of the Men's bathroom in the main casino area.  Above every urinal is a picture of a lust-crazed girl staring over your bits with a camera, magnifying glass, tape measure, etc, while you pee.  The first time I saw this, it was \"ha ha\" funny, then when the laughter died, it just turned creepy and weird for me.  I actually selected a urinal based off which girl creeped me out the least.  She merely looked like she was casting spells at my nethers.  I could live with that.\n\nLadies: I must know.  Is there something like this in the girl's restroom?  When you close the stall door to do your business, is there a picture of some crazed guy making grabbing motions where your boobs would be?  Please message me and let me know.  I'd really like to know what the Hell you get in your bathroom after my gender's discovery.\n\nAs critical as I am being, there looks to be some sort of steampunk-themed club called \"Triumph\" there.  I want to check this out.  Atonement for the death of my beloved Warp Core Breach booze bowl?  We'll see, but it's going to have to be pretty good to replace the hole in my heart from that much booze for so cheap a price.\n\nThe sad part is, Hilton's one of those \"history rich\" casinos here.  Look up the history on this place.  A lot of awesome stars and vintage Vegas stuff happened here, which makes you wonder why this isn't represented more.\n\nThis place is great for convention visitors to stay, but that's about it as far as I can see.  They need to figure themselves out for everything else.","date":"2011-01-09 00:09:50"}

I went to Huntersville Ford yesterday to get an oil change on my commuter car.  Paid my $41.00 and was given back my car just over an hour later.\nToday I had to go to work (40 mile round trip commute).  As I was getting off of I-85, I noticed the smell of burning oil.  I thought maybe the tech just spilled a little on the exhaust manifold since it's right there, and maybe it's burning off.  I didn't hit a stop light until I was almost at my office.  When I stopped and was waiting for the light, my cabin started to fill with smoke, and I had smoke pouring out from under the hood and the wheel wells as well.\nI pulled over into the parking area of a gas station (because they have accessible fire extinguishers) and parked.  I popped the hood only to find THE TECHNICIAN DID NOT PUT THE OIL FILLER CAP BACK ON!!!  Now my engine is covered in potentially flammable oil, and of course Huntersville Ford is closed today!!!!\nI have my car sitting outside in the parking lot with the hood open, just in case it decides to ignite, because my engine is pretty hot after a 20 mile drive.\nI called and left a voicemail, and now I have to find a way to degrease my engine at work, just so I can drive it home in a less-flammable state.  I WILL HOLD HUNTERSVILLE FORD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY COMPONENTS THAT FAIL AS OF A RESULT OF THIS.  Most electronics don't like being slathered in motor oil.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they aren't designed for that.\n\nAnd NO, I did not have other work done... Just the oil change.  You had 1 job.... oil change.  No transmission service, no brake service, no rotation, no cooling flush... just an oil change.  I hope he remembered to tighten the filter, but I am skeptical at this point.\n\nI can assure you, I will NOT be taking my car back to that dealership, even though it is right around the corner from my house.

Every restaurant was packed before the show, so we set on wandering MGM afterwards for a good after show nosh and were definitely pleased at Crush. Luckily we were seated right away (not many people ordering dinner at 11pm I suppose!) and our incredibly nice server saw to our drink order ASAP.\n\nThe ambience is tres chic. Dark, romantic, and removed from casino craziness in the back where we sat cuddled up in a booth. The only negative about our seats was the pretty chilly draft, but perhaps we were just too sober ;) The Syrah was absolutely delicious, and at $11 for a glass, a Vegas bargain. We began with the Caesar salad which came out within minutes of ordering and was very tasty, though I myself found the sweetness to be a little strange. Overall it was a crunchy, refreshing delight. We then shared a margherita flatbread and the gnocchi. Whoa....both dishes definitely exceeded expectations. They were small plates, but really perfect for sharing. The speed at which the salad was delivered was slightly misleading, as the other dishes took quite a while to come out. However, they were clearly exceptionally fresh when they arrived.\n\nOur waiter was pretty busy but as attentive as he could be, and very professional without being overbearing. The end-to-end experience was more than I expected at such a large venue, and thus deserves a high recommendation.

Took away from the whole Padthai eating experience that comes with the flat noodles and the flavors it generates. It was also extremely sweet marinated and had no particularly Thai spice flavors.

I won't deny my dog needed some serious grooming.  We'd brushed him out the night before but he could still use more combing, his hind legs\/butt trimmed up and he had some matts behind his ear.  There are 4 doors at this place, I believe. If you just pull in to the drive way it's not terribly clear until you get closer to the doors and see signs directing you which to go into.  The lobby is cute. I was quickly greeted and I was given a form to complete. The woman doing the grooming introduced herself and I asked that his hind legs and butt get trimmed up and asked that she cut out any matts.  She said it would probably take about 3 hours.  I received a text about 3 1\/2 hours later stating the price would be $80 and if I returned within 8 weeks it would be $65.  I went to pick him up and I was shocked that they shaved him.  His hair was NOT that bad.  Not to mention the hair that was left was not soft as it has been after visiting other groomers.  I didn't say anything because I was so shocked in the moment so I took him home.  We saw our dog paying particular attention to his private area...more so than he usually does.  My husband looked closer and found that he had been nicked a couple of times.  We found a large cut behind one of his ears.  We won't be returning.","date":"2016-03-07 00:34:42"}

This review was tough to give, as it could've been anywhere between 2 and 4 stars.\n\nLet's start with the positives. I came here with a friend for Summerlicious this afternoon at 12:30, and we got the last seat in the restaurant (it helped that we reserved). We were given the menu and our order was taken in about 3-4 minutes. Not bad to start.\n\nI ordered the miso soup, green salad, ebi shiumai, sushi\/sashimi\/maki, and green tea ice cream. The miso soup and green salad tasted nothing special (the soup was a little salty though). The ebi shiumai tasted really good! The sushi\/sashimi\/maki tasted very good as well, and I especially love how there's a much higher raw fish-rice ratio compared to other restaurants I go to. Finally, the green tea ice cream was a great dessert to finish.\n\nEverything with the food satisfied me. The service, after having the order taken, was a near disaster. I understand it was a busy day today due to the fact it was a nice Friday, but many of the servers were confused in their roles. There was a long lineup of orders by the sushi counter, and at one point I saw 15 dishes lining up ready for serving, but no servers were going to pick them up. I didn't receive my shiumai until 1:00, and my sushi\/sashimi\/maki until around 1:20. I finished everything by around 1:30, but the ice cream didn't come until around 1:40, and finally the bill didn't come till around 1:55. After 1 hour and 35 minutes, I finally left the restaurant at 2:05, since I had to ask for the credit card machine, in which no server was around for about 8 minutes before I finally got one's attention.\n\nWhat probably saved this from a 2-star (or even a 1-star rating) was the fact the manager came out to me as I was signing my receipt saying how they were horribly understaffed and completely underestimated the demand for Summerlicious this year. They only had two sushi chefs, four servers, and two chefs serving what was a full house restaurant. In a way I felt bad, but I did give them just less than 10% tips; something I almost never do in restaurant.\n\nFree wifi! Password is the phone number. Perhaps as a sucker for free wifi that might have contributed to the 3-star rating I gave. However, be warned.","date":"2013-07-13 00:57:45"}

I ordered the hangover burger, and they not only asked how I wanted my burger (can choose from medium to well-done) but the worker even asked how runny I wanted the fried egg and then if I wanted it sunny side up or if they should flip it over easy. My buddy asked for mustard, and they even asked whether he wanted regular yellow, dijon, whole grain, or honey mustard. I added sweet potato fries for the $1 upcharge because I love sweet potato fries, paid my $10 and waited. I must say I was a little disappointed that I had to wait 15 minutes for the burger, but after first bite I had no more complaints!\nI don't know what's in Pat LaFreida's beef mixture, but it was the highest quality beef in a burger I've ever ordered. The bun was ridiculously soft as well. The egg was cooked perfectly, but the burger lacked any flavor from the small slice of cheese or the bacon hash unfortunately. Despite that, the amazing quality still made this burger awesome. \nThe sweet potato fries were by far the best sweet potato fries I've ever eaten, and I love sweet potato fries so that says a lot. They were crispy which so many places cannot accomplish and had a balance of sweetness from the fries and salt that was perfect. They came with a decent maple sauce, but I didn't dip very many because they were honestly better on their own. I must say, the bang bang sauce that comes on the side of the burgers is incredible though. It's similar to a Thousand Island dressing without the pickle relish, but something about it just makes it so much better and slightly sweeter. \nOverall, I probably wouldn't order the hangover again and would choose a more flavorful\/interesting option. I would also recommend going with a double if you're hungry because each patty is only around 4 ounces. Despite these slight \"drawbacks\", the quality of the meat and bun stood out so much that I think any burger here would be amazing and for a pretty solid price as well.","date":"2015-06-08 18:56:14"}

Some people don't like that, but I do, it forces restaurants to practice more hygienic practices because customers can see more. \n\nThe young lady who rang me up was helpful and friendly.

They were both DELICIOUS. Many kabobs in this city are incredibly bland and under seasoned, definitely not the case here. The rice was also well flavored.

Really???? What a great way to handle an error in the production of the glasses.  When I objected to being relegated to reading with one eye with my new glasses, the reply was...\"Well, then you'll have to see the Dr. again, and no, he is not available now.\"  No offer to look up his schedule and see when I could see him again, or see if another Dr. could see me then to resolve it.  After the poor response to the problem (you would think they would have some professional way to deal with when glasses come back from the mfr\/lens maker and there is an unexpected issue).  I told them I'm not a patient here any longer and took my useless glasses home and resolved to find a quality optometry office and start over.  I did call back and spoke with an Office Mgr, who stated she would look into the matter and get back to me, but never did.  So I called again and toild them to toss my file out and not contact me again for any future appts. \n Another thing about their exams.....as part of your exam, they offer to take optional (extra cost) retina photos so you can also have a look at your retinas on a computer screen with the Dr., using a clumsy cube-shaped camera. You sit there and they have you smush your face up against a flat glass panel on the front while they take repeated attempts to get a good photo of your retina. They charge extra if you want this option. Then they raised the price, and I declined due to raising the price. They were charging plenty for that option already.  I moved to a different office that does not charge anything extra at all for the retina photos, and uses a better camera than the camera cube, so no more smushing my face against a flat glass window.\n(Note: using fake name here for privacy protection from internet identity thieves.)","date":"2018-07-17 00:21:32"}

We ate here on the day before New Year's Eve so that may have been why we easily got a reservation at prime dinner time.  Everything from start to finish was pretty much impeccable. \n\nSourdough bread in the shape of leaves were brought out immediately with softened butter in a small ramekin.  One thing I hate is when warm bread is brought out with butter that is ice cold and hard to spread on the bread, so I really appreciated that the butter was the right temperature to easily spread.\n\nFor a starter, we split the Terrine of foie gras which was delicious.  It has a thin layer of braised beef ground down to a coarse pate texture, then a thin layer of foie gras, then a layer of prune gelee.  Served with crostini and a small frisee salad.  The slightly slightly saltier beef and the creamy foie went so well together. The prune gelee added that touch of cool sweetness that made it all work together.  A dish I would definitely recommend.\n\nFor our entrees, I got the Steak frites, and Mark H had the Leg of lamb (Gigot d'Agneau.)  Mine was hangar steak topped with caramelized onions served with a compound butter and a healthy portion of nicely crispy, thinly cut fries.  The steak was cooked to a perfect mid rare and was tender.  The onions and the compound butter did overpower the steak a bit, though.\n\nMark H's dish on the other hand, was the better of the two.  The roasted leg of lamb was just so tender and flavorful,  the knife cut through the meat like butter.  The lamb was served with flageolet beans and braised escarole.  Our server asked him when he was ordering if he wanted any sides to go with it since it didn't come with a starch but the beans and escarole was enough for an entree portion.  Besides, I know he wanted to save room for dessert.\n\nFor dessert, we split the Banana crepe gateau.  Layers of crepes with banana pastry cream between them, served with salted caramel and french vanilla gelato.   This was pretty amazing as well.  I've had some fantasic gateau de crepes in france and this one really reminded me of being there.  The banana flavor was a bit too subtle for me but that salted caramel was like heaven.  Such an incredible texture to it with that bright kick of salt, damn.  The french vanilla gelato was memorable as well.  Nice silky texture and oh so creamy.\n\nThe next time I'm there,  we really have to try their breakfast.","date":"2016-01-04 04:06:15"}

There was another couple sitting outside (they only had 2 tables with 2 little chairs outside, so not much of a patio incase anyone was curious). \n\nAnywho, me and my boyfriend took a couple of minutes to decide what to try because there were at least 30 flavors to choose from. The small and medium give you 2 flavors to try from, the large gives you 3. He chose the small with coconut and mango gelato and I had the small Oreo and dolce de leche. \n\nThe coconut tasted AMAZING. But the mango was the show stopper, it was amazing. To anyone who loves the fruit, this is just as good if not better (yes, I went there!)\n\nThe Oreo tasted like plain vanilla. I barely tasted any cookie pieces. So avoid it unless you want a plain vanilla taste. The dolce de leche was really good, a little on the sweet side but still enjoyable. \n\nAll in all, we paid about $11 for both small gelatos.

I checked in on Saturday during memorial day weekend, waited 30 minutes to try to valet park my car and failed to get on the porte cochere due to mismanagement and understaffed valet crew.  There is no excuse for that kind of thing at a hotel especially where there is no self park option.  Ended up parking across the street at the mall to check in, ridonkulous.\n\nThe service at the front desk was good to great, they were apologetic about the valet and whenever I called down for my car (once I was able to valet my car), they fought to have my car ready by the time I got down.  Accommodations are decent, nice big jet tubs, good sized rooms and a mini kitchenette in the studios to boot because these are condotel units.  The location, despite being off strip, is workable because you're walking distance to the Wynn and directly across the street from Fashion Show.  If you're staying here, you probably don't want a casino and so being next to fashion show is a plus.  \n\nI can't stress how understaffed this hotel seemed to be and so I probably won't stay here again if I'm paying the same price as a on-strip 4star hotel.  I was able to book at a $100 discount to other comparable hotels with a casino though so something to keep in mind.","date":"2012-05-28 19:53:06"}

The original location was at about 52nd McDowell(it was a treat after squaw peak hike with da)( but they have been at the current location for probably the last 20 years. They have a good mix of North Indian and South Indian food. Masala dosas have always been one of my favorites things to get. The vegies and sambar are always fresh as well. The title may not say it here but they are just as famous for all the amazing sweets they make as well. Indians from all over town order it by the tray but if you arent sure what you want to order ask them to sample it. Jalebi barfi and laddu are some of my go to's. I'm an american born and raised indian so I'm suggesting some of the more tame whitewashed options. The service is quick and the staff is always attentive. You'll see an crowd of ASU kids definitely during cricket matches but they also have indian music videos playing throughout the day. Before I forget my favorite thing to get from there to go is pani puri!. Picture a cracker like hollow bubble with potatoes chickpeas and a spicy sauce. yes my mouth is watering just describing it. I put in mint chutney and tamardind chutney. Im confident you have will a few items that you love and will have again and again.","date":"2015-11-05 23:02:06"}

Having tried two of the pastas and the gnocchi, my impression is that these dishes are the food version of jazz improv - discordant and overwhelming.  Like the music, I can see how the Pasta Bar dishes may appeal to many, particularly those who favor flavor intensity and\/or creativity over all else.  For my taste buds, this was overload.  Interesting yes, but I can't say I found it good.\nHere are some details:  \nPasta and gnocchi - both are quite heavy and substantial.  I prefer a more tender pasta and pillow-light gnocchi.  Maybe after running a marathon the high-density pasta would hold more appeal.\nSauces - Here is the in-your-face part.  The gnocchi sauce is spicy, overwhelmingly so for me (although I do freely admit to being a hot chili wimp).  Despite my personal intolerance to hot food, a more delicate approach would have been better.\nThe le Sarde sauce sounded interesting, mainly because I love sardines, but my taste buds could not get over the bizarre combination of strong flavors vying for attention. I could not even pick out the taste of the sardines amongst the culinary noise.  And what is with the dried hunks of bread?  I could not get beyond the oddness of this one.  \nThe carbonara was an intense combination of garlic and black pepper flavors, and probably the dish I enjoyed most of the three.  Even on this one, the garlic was out of this world in intensity.\nOn the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.  The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.  The ingredients all appeared fresh and high quality.  And the food is indeed interesting - this is no boring spaghetti\/lasagna place.\nAs a matter of taste, I'm going to have to pass on Pasta Bar.  For the price, I'll be looking for more of a flavor symphony.  If culinary improv and high-density pasta is your thing, check it out.","date":"2009-03-01 19:50:23"}

Chips and salsa were excellent. \n\nI would give this place a strong 4 stars for food and atmosphere. The place had a very nice atmosphere though was a bit loud. \n\nThe reason for the 3 stars was the service. While they were extremely nice when asked for anything, we had to ask, often. Missing parts of our orders, incorrect items on check and a standard dinner of drinks, apps, and entrees took over 2 hours.

We played a few rounds and then she let us jump privately because there was no party after us.\nThe place feels so clean. They have a free place for your shoes and belongings and seats all around so you can watch your kids jump if you aren't jumping too, where at Sky Zone you see parents standing at the entrance or sitting on the ground in those narrow walkways. The regular jump area is nice and open and they have a separate netted off area for younger kids that the parents can also jump in. Unlike Sky Zone that have small kids to one side, 8-10 yr olds in the middle and adults to the other side. \nIt's very sensory friendly also. I wish FEAT would consider hosting family nights there.

You know you're at home, but someone's moved something, rearranged the furniture, or otherwise changed things ever so slightly but just enough to make you suspicious. This wasn't the Epicure Cafe that I remember from three or four years ago.\n\nI learned from Jackie, our cutesy server who was a total dupe for actress Clea DuVall, that a few years ago Epicure changed locations. To a few doors down farther east on Queen, on the same side of the street. Which explains the slightly-different-but-not-quite layout, decor and seating. It was a pleasant surprise. I didn't venture upstairs but I was told there's an outdoor eating area that will have to be explored on my next visit.\n\nThe menu options are, like others have said, a bit overwhelming. But for the fussy eater (I was with one of them) there was no lack of choice - Epicure has everything from pasta (17 choices, including different sauces and shapes), burgers, pizza, wraps and another full page of duck\/veal\/lamb\/chicken options. I appreciate the selection but it could stand to be honed a little! Luckily Jackie was able to recommend favourites when we showed indecision. \n\nMy eyes went straight for the Pumpkin Ravioi ($14), which I was assured was \"not a mistake\". And it wasn't. I barely looked up my from my plate as I feasted my eyes on the glorious, pillowy ravioli on my plate. They were seasoned with ginger and nutmeg, tossed in parmesan cream sauce with grilled corn, wilted spinach and mushrooms. The mushrooms were perfectly sauteed, the spinach was wilted just right and the corn was fresh and added the exact amount of crunch that the dish needed. The portion wasn't skimpy either - at some restaurants when you order jumbo ravioli you get 3-4 pieces, but this was more than double the size. Good value for the money.\n\nI was more than tempted by the dessert board (tartufo, ice cream, tiramisu, Grand Marnier cheesecake or crème caramel, Belgian chocolate mousse, apple crumble) but unfortunately dinner left me positively STUFFED. After seeing that Epicure is now open until 1 or 2am every night I know where I'll be heading for late night dessert!","date":"2009-05-20 03:22:43"}

Especially when it just hits the table, it'll have you scratching your head. Once it cools, the \"meat\" starts to get a bit of texture, but it still pretty great.

We also noticed all the flowers outside were fake and pretty worn out, which made the place look ridiculous, cheap, and unkempt. So for environment, we would rate it a 2 star.We placed our order online, which was convenient, but when we showed up to pick up our food the place was dead and we couldn't find anyone to help us. Two employees actually made eye contact with us and then went right back to talking and slacking off. After about 10 minutes, someone did finally wander up front to get us our order. \n\nWe ordered the stuffed mushrooms, Penne San Remo, stuffed shells, and chocolate chip cannolis. The meal came with french bread but the bread was stale and cold. The mushrooms weren't too bad. The sauce was tasty but the stuffing overpowered the mushrooms so it ended up tasting like sharp cheese and sauce. The penne san remo is supposed to contain artichoke but we only found two chunks of artichoke out of a container with enough food to feed 3 people. So that was disappointing. The sauce was also really bland and the chicken was overcooked\/rubbery. The stuffed shells were ok, no major issues, they just weren't worth the price. Actually, none of the food we got was worth the price. We paid over 60 dollars for a dinner that was maybe worth 30. All in all we weren't impressed and won't be returning.","date":"2014-05-07 20:22:14"}

He makes you feel as if you are the one and only guests he has to please and take care of and everything he did he seemed to truly enjoy!

You start off with the artisan bread (OMG - SO SO DELISH) and their famous spinning salad. The prime rib just melts in your mouth! The cuts we had were good size - Mun made sure of that! - and I had the mashed potatoes and creamed spinach which was so fabulous.

Only friends and family were invited. We felt very special- either to be considered part of the Spicy Pickle family, or maybe because we made such ridiculous fools of ourselves at the window that they thought we might be \"special\" in the other meaning. Perhaps.\nEither way, free lunch.\n\nIt's not as though I could give a stinky review to anything given to me for free- I might feel bad- but this was just what the doctor ordered. \n\nNot for the weak at heart.\n\nIt's not just a clever name. Their pickles are actually spicy. They seems to be lightly dusted with some kind of chile powder. A nice kick follows a good bite.\n\nI ordered the Dilly something or other. It was half a sandwich (sub or panini) with a bowl of soup. I chose the Corn and Green Chile Bisque with the Sausalito Bandito panini. Delish! It also passed my spicy- enough- for- me- test. Yes, I needed multiple napkins for my nose.\nI could have taken a little more spice, so next time I might ask them to kick it up a notch, but it was a refreshing foray back to my traveling days when I tried to convince a chef in India that, no, I am actually not white. I just have REALLY light skin. Never worked.\n\nAl had the Aztec pizzeti. Coming from NY, I am particular about pizza. This looked like it fit the bill. Very think and crispy crust. A little too much cheese for my taste, but most people out here like it like that. She loved it, along with her bowl of loaded potato soup.\n\nMickey had the Gobbler with a side salad. When she bit into the panini she made a face that I think should remain in the bedroom. Enough said.\n\nBryan had the salad and enjoyed it immensely. It didn't look like much, but I might have to return when they open tomorrow and try it out for myself. The croutons did look very appetizing.\n\nOne of the attentive staff members made the rounds with a tray of mini chocolate chip cookies. Fantastic. Crispy on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside. Mama like.\n\nAll in all, I'll be back. Probably tomorrow. And maybe the day after...\n\nAMENDMENT:\nOK, so I did go back the next day... and today (which is the following day). Yesterday I had the tuna salad, which was delish. Theur tuna is a little kicked up, as it's made with chipotle mayo (but really not too much) and spoicy pickle relish. Tasty. It was served over a bed of greens with a lemon olive oil dressing.\nToday I had the med sub. It was ok- nothing out of the ballpark. I got it with the spoinach salad, which was also delish. \n\nDown to 4.5, but alas no halfs...\n\nStick with the paninis and the salads. Maybe the soups too. I have yet to try the pizzetti... stay tuned.","date":"2007-12-11 03:52:39"}

The last time I came here, while they tried to accommodate me and fix the issue, the fries were hard and not salted enough and the burger tasted very bad.  This is rare and that's why I'm only docking one star, but for some reason, one of the fry cooks didn't add salt to the fries and they always have before.  The cashier said you could ask for salt, but what frustrated me is that they were always perfectly salted before and while I understand some people will say it's too salty, you can't go from quite salty to no salt at all. That's quite the change.

I ask about the happy hour to which the woman working responded they don't have a happy hour since they are running specials. I'm a little sad about the happy hour thing being scratched off but I have had The Otheroom to go before and was pleased with the food so I decided to look at the menu and order something good. I then wait about ten minutes before being approached and the whole time I was sitting there was a guy making drinks and nothing else. How can they have only one bartender?

I understand people want to split your tab and whatever else but there was a third guy who could have handled whatever problem they had at the register.

We bought an air-conditioner from them in 2014 and one just last summer in 2015.  We've had nothing but problems since the very first day we had it installed.  Not only that, but the guy who comes out is completely rude and his office seems to back him up.  This is a unit which holds 5-tons of Puron so it is pretty big and it's not cheap.  We spent $5000 on the unit and it is still under warranty.  It's a good thing, too, because these people have had to replace it once and now it's compressor just blew yesterday morning.  It had been making horrible noises and shutting down and about a week ago, they came out and replaced the thermostat and the air seemed to work, but it was making an even more horrible noise than before and then 2 nights ago it stopped working altogether again.  So, it just so happens that my roommate was going to call them yesterday, anyway, to come out and fix it AGAIN.  However, before he did, all of a sudden, I heard the loudest BOOM!  I mean, it was like a bomb going off and literally was louder than a shotgun being fired close by.  Then, it had this awful constant noise - like I've never heard before and vapor was coming out of the hose by the valve and there was a funny smell and I didn't know what was going on and I panicked because I wasn't sure if it was smoke or Puron or what so I ran into the house, turned off all of the units, made sure all of our cats were okay and ran back outside real quick with fire-extinguishers just in case it was smoke.  My roommate called them and they said they'd be there within the hour.  Two hours later, a little after noon, the guy shows up and says it's the compressor that totally blew and he'd have to order another one and that they were going to charge $1200 for labor for the 5-hour job it was going to take to do it.  The compressor, itself, is still under warranty.  He tried to say that the problem was our faulty electrical and that it was on our end, therefore, they were not at all to blame for this.  Also, he said this was a completely different issue than the thermostat, which he claimed was a good call and that he did fix that problem correctly.  So, we hired an electrician (one who is extremely reputable) to come out and assess the situation because if it was our end, we knew we needed to not only get it fixed immediately for safety reasons, but I may have owed the guy an apology for insinuating this could have been their fault to begin with.  The electrician came and his findings were that #1, the units were too close to one another to begin with and that after checking the voltages, etc. with his do-hicky (LOL), his findings showed there was not one problem with our electricity, no surges or imbalanced distributions of power, no breaker problems, etc. on our end and he even called his friend who owns another air-conditioning company and his friend told him that had it been on our end it would have not only showed up in his readings, but it would have had to be a surge large enough to, at the very least, surge other electronic items in our home and that really...  it would more realistically be an outage-type surge where other neighbors would also have been affected.  Not only that, but both agreed that there's no way that it should be a 5-hour job to replace a compressor and that the money they were telling us they were going to charge was outlandish.

It's shame that the exquisitely tender chicken didn't smack much of jerk seasoning, though.

I gotta say the flavours of Georgian cuisine is quite unique. These dishes seemed to be made to order because it took quite some time to receive. It may have been more than half an hour.\nMy favorite would be the hachapuri. It makes me think of having pizza but the cheese is distinctly salty and they roll up the boat edges with cheese so the crust is a delight to eat. I wish there were 2 eggs. It definitely balanced the saltiness of the cheese (feta?). It seemed like there were 2 layers of cheese: the crusty top and a layer of soft chese below.\nThe khinkali reminds me of Chinese dumplings but the flavours are truly very different from what I'm used to. It was creamy and dark. Each serving contained 3 dumplings  which doesn't seem like a lot but it really is like its own meal. It definitely needed something to cut the heaviness.\nWhile waiting for the food, we got complimentary appetizers: bread, pickled cabbage and an array of sauces (tomato, Georgian, spicy). The sauces and the pickled cabbage all have tastes I am not familiar with. I ate it all because the food was taking so long to come. The pickled cabbage I did not like so much.\nAll in all, the service was good, the food was filling and I was satisfied.","date":"2016-01-17 05:47:00"}

How can that be? The Lotus Garden has been around for 60 years and there's no question as to why. The food is fantastic and the staff is very friendly and accomodating.\n\nMy meal always starts out with an egg roll. These are no ordinary egg rolls...they're not tiny, and aren't considered one of those side items tossed in as an afterthought as at most Chinese restaurants. No - these egg rolls could be a meal! Filled with baby shrimp, cabbage, and carrots, the filling is tender with a bit of a crunch. The wrapper isn't your typical thin, fried, \"papery skin\". The wrapper is a bit more substantial because of the size of the egg roll..yet it's crisp on the outside and a little chewy on the inside. The best egg rolls I've ever eaten.\n\nI also like to order the fried pork dumplings. They're pretty basic as pork dumplings go, but they have a great flavor and the dipping sauce is very good. I'm pretty picky about my dumpling sauce. I don't like it too salty or too sweet. This is just perfect with a touch of heat.\n\nMy main course staple is the chicken with garlic sauce. This is noted on the menu as a spicy item. The Thai red pepper flakes give it the right amount of heat without overpowering the garlic brown sauce. It's a simple dish with slivers of white meat chicken, slivered water chestnuts, and a few mushrooms tossed in for good measure. This dish is so flavorful that you don't need anything else. I love the chicken paired with the crunch of the water chestnuts. They both take on the flavor of the sauce quite well. \n\nOther great dishes are the chicken lo mein, General Tso's Chicken, and chicken with broccoli.\n\nPlus the atmosphere is welcoming and cozy.

Basically I curated this woman's art, sacred objects and artifacts collection and needless to say it was a very memorable week working in what you can imagine to be a very eclectic home.  When the job finished my client invited the crew and I to a celebration dinner which brought us to a restaurant in Inglewood on 9th avenue S.E. called Sugo Caffe Italia.\n\nJust sitting outside Sugo I felt underdressed and so did my co-workers but our appetites and curiosity managed to find our way into the restaurant where our reservation of 6 was warmly greeted by the staff.  The decor in this restaurant is exquisite, simple and clean with accents of contemporary earthy art pieces on warm muted walls.  Jarred tomatoes and jams are illuminated upwards with mini lights shining brightly from beneath them and antique chandeliers hang above dripping with crystal raindrops and lined pearl beads.  There is no corner that has not been thought out decoration wise here and the table settings are complete with artisan ceramics and fine crystal glassware.\n\nAn average meal is between 20 to 40 dollars but once you savour the many dishes on a menu that changes every evening and the many cheese options that I couldn't pronounce you are completely titillated.  Every meal's presentation has been evoked with an artist's touch and the freshest ingredients are presented in front of you to tantalize your palate.  I was extremely impressed by an ample Scotch list, over 15 choices and the huge portions of deserts that were presented in the most elegant formations that look like one could almost wear them as head pieces.\n\nI was so impressed by Sugo the first time that I took my partner there to have our own celebration dinner the very next evening.\n\nAbsolutely 5 stars without a question.","date":"2009-10-14 02:33:41"}

The remodel after Buttita's is as good as one can do when turning a lovely restaurant into a sports bar-style restaurant (though why one would want to do that is beyond me).  And that's where the good stuff stops.\nIn short, the service and all things related to it were glacially slow; the food, when it arrived, was mediocre at best -- and missing key elements (one whole order, and other parts).  This restaurant cannot possibly last if they don't figure out how to greet and serve customers, or get the food that was ordered actually to the tables.\nThe full story.\nUpon arrival, we found a vacant hostess stand, then a long walk down the hall to the dining room along which we saw no one who works there.  Luckily, we ran into friends who assured us that we could seat ourselves.\nAfter waiting at our table for some 15 minutes, we used a bit of self-help, and accosted a waitress to ask for some menus.  After another 5-7 minutes another waitress finally showed up with menus and silverware. She did not offer water, or to bring us a drink of any sort - just plopped the menus down and disappeared.\nQuite some time later, our waitress arrived, apologetically, and took our order.  We ordered an appetizer (cheese fries), and three meals: 1 burger (would have been on wheat bread but despite the menu, they had none), one 1\/2 ribeye (which the menu says was supposed to be thick, but which was certainly not), that should have come with some interesting sounding twice baked potato casserole, and one individual pizza.  My daughter ordered a diet, I ordered water, and my husband ordered a beer.\nThe water and diet only took about 7 minutes to arrive.\nThe appetizer might have arrived after another 10, but the food runner carrying the plate of cheese fries tried to deliver them to another table. Having learned he had the wrong table, the lad just took them back to the kitchen.\nEventually, the cheese fries arrived.  They weren't as hot as one would like, and for the price, there should have been a LOT more cheese.  The fries were no better than I could make using frozen crinkle fries from the grocery.\nWithin 3 minutes of the appetizer's tardy arrival, some of our food arrived.\nThe burger (but not the beer), and my steak with vegetable, but no potato casserole, and no pizza.\nThe waitress arrived, and asked if everything was there, we told her \"no\", and pointed out that we were missing the beer, the potatoes and the pizza.  Ten minutes later the beer arrived.\nMy husband then went up to the window where the pizza would have been put up for a food runner -- no pizza had been ordered.\nSo. \nThe steak was fatty, but moderately tasty, if only tepid.  The broccoli was cold, the burger was not as good as you can get at, say Hardee's (despite costing twice as much). \nWe never did get the pizza.  Or the potatoes.  \nI DID offer to come in as a consulting manager to help them teach the staff how to actually wait tables......","date":"2013-12-07 02:26:13"}

I concur with the commenter who noted that the parking situation is difficult.  However, being close to I-15 and Spring Mountain is a huge advantage for me, and it is open 24 hours.\n\nA relatively new member of the staff is Tony, who recently left Saigon 8.  The guy is terrific, and I've seen him iron out the bumps when language is a problem.  He's the reason I came to this restaurant in the first place.\n\nI've had pho twice and vermicelli with grilled pork, spicy (#68) once.  The pho broth was pretty good (not quite Saigon 8, but not bad), and the meat, etc., was also good.  The #68 was the best thing I've had there, and it is served in a bowl rather than a plate, which I think helped.  The restaurant was jam packed (Friday, about 1:30 p.m.), but service went smoothly.  By the time I was finished, I would say about two thirds of the crowd had left after eating.\n\nAt the table, There was hoisin sauce and Sriracha hot sauce, plus fish sauce and soy sauce.  There was also a jar of a pepper sauce that looked like a Szechuan sauce, but didn't have the heat.  There were plain wooden chop sticks, which I like, spoons, and small saucers, which I use to mix a dip.  I've mentioned in my Jenny Pho review that this is the way I prefer it, instead of bringing stuff out with the pho, and using lacquered chop sticks.\n\nOne thing you should know is that there is a sign that says cash only.  That changed a couple of months ago.  They allow major credit cards (Visa, MC), but they left the sign up.\n\nI like the restaurant for the quality of the food, which is pretty good, location, near I-15, and the fact that Tony now works here, and he's terrific.\n\nSomething I should have said earlier:  Pho Little Saigon makes its own Vietnamese sandwiches.  I brought some home, and they're very good.  Pho Saigon 8 doesn't  make its own, though there's a shop that makes them out the rear of their parking lot.","date":"2014-11-30 01:24:25"}

Than Joes Farm Grill is the place for you. Even if you have simple tastes Joes Farm Grill will have something to suit your needs.  It has beautiful decoration, great food and affordable prices, so why not pay a visit. \nJoes Farm Grill has a long historical background, with a house originally built in 1966 by the Johnston family. In later years it was decided to turn the farm into a restaurant with its food being home grown or locally brought in. The house development around the farm is Agritopia, and was dedicated to permanent urban farming. In fact if you live in the development surrounding the restaurant you can rent a garden lot to grow vegetables.  All of their products are certified USDA organic, and their focus is common food done uncommonly. They feel fresh food taste better and are better for you so why not share all that with the customers. They take the foods taste to a new level with all of the recipes and ingredients. \nJoes Farm Grill is delicious, unique and a fun experience. I feel most restaurants are chains and don't have the history behind them like Joes does, and because of this it makes the experience much more special. Knowing your food is organic makes it taste ten times better, and knowing you don't have to spend a fortune for organic makes me want to go again. It's really stands out among most and everyone in the chandler area needs to stop by and visit. \n First walking up to the twelve acre masterpiece is like going through a farm, with orange trees covering the path and large oaks surrounding it which gives a beautiful green glow of a garden.  It smells fresh and gives you an earthy vive. They are enormous and full of green vegetables that look extremely appetizing. They are covering most of the land and you can walk through them and see your food growing.  The building is white with large windows showing the back and the front equally, and the inside has simple decorations with light blue and green accents not to overpower the beauty of the vegetation growing outside. It holds no more than a hundred people and is rather spacious seating. The entire restaurant is very simple with a 60s feel mixed with a futuristic time. I ordered the jumbo breaded shrimp with fries, French toast banana peanut butter sandwich and the barbeque chicken pizza. I went with my sister because the portions are rather large and I could not have eaten it by myself. This was my first time visiting the restaurant and my sisters second. Everything so far was very pleasant and the employees were very nice. No more than ten minutes later our food was ready and it looked and smelt great. We sat down and I tried each dish, starting with the shrimp which were very large. The shrimp was crunchy and juicy and was simple and not overpowering. I thought it tasted very good and wasn't too rich which is a problem I normally find when ordering shrimp. Then I tried the French toast peanut butter sandwiches that surprisingly had strawberry's in it too. This was one of the best tasting things I have ever had! It was a house specialty and lives up to its name. It tasted like a gourmet peanut butter sandwich and was so flavorful and sweet. I had to order another one. Then I tried the barbeque pizza, I liked it but it wasn't my favorite. It was thin crust and slightly burnt, but it did taste good with the cheese and chicken combination. It just tasted like there was too many ingredients on the pizza that overpowered it. The prices weren't that bad either, the shrimp was the most expensive at 14.99 when I go again I probably won't order this again, just because it wasn't a to die for dish.  The peanut butter sandwiches were 10.99 and I crave these every day it was amazing! Than last the pizza was 12.99, my sister liked it more than I did so it depends on your taste but I probably will try something else. \nThe most important part though is the food, and not to leave you hanging was no matter what spectacular. Fresh fries galore. The most appealing part to me was the decorations and the gardens surrounding the place. I think the set up as if you're in a food court is a really interesting concept; you have to throw away your own food on trays, and clean up after yourself. I didn't expect that and I think it's a smart move on the restaurants part.  The calm and relaxing atmosphere, and no rush pace is really nice. \nI enjoyed Joes Farm Grill and I plan on visiting again. I think the organic concept and urban farming is a really nice thing to hear about in today's society. I feel better knowing I'm eating organic, and knowing there are still places that are going strong with the idea of organic. I hope the success of this restaurant shows others they can do the same. This restaurant meets all my needs as a customer, clean, green and tasty what more could you want.","date":"2012-06-25 23:41:20"}

Fantastic service, incredible food, great choices, terrific atmosphere... this is now my go-to place for an overall grand experience.  They offer Valet parking which I love... nothing worse than getting all dressed up and having to walk 2 blocks to get to your destination.  It is $3 plus tip... just an FYI.  We always make reservations just to be sure we'll get in.  If the tables not ready they have a very nice bar area to enjoy a cocktail while you wait.  Both times recently our table was ready even though we arrived a bit early so we just sat down.  Service is A+, first class all the way.  You can just relax and enjoy your dinner.  Things I love, Sea Bass!  OMG it is wonderful!  If you like Sea Bass... get it.  It is a huge portion and its usually market price...  Last time I ordered it was $35 which I thought very reasonable considering the portion size.  Very easily shared by two with smaller appetites. Sorry... back to appetizers... Oyster lovers love the oysters here!  they are on the happy hour menu in the bar area.  Yellowtail sashimi is OMG to die for.  Heirloom tomato salad was fantastic too.  Filet always a good choice... The asparagus was cooked to perfection and I would choose the augratin potatoes over the twice baked.  Ive had both and I prefer mashed or baked usually but these augratin are wow... really great.  The Sole is super!  It is a HUGE portion so unless you are a big eater or you are sharing... there is too much to eat but its prepared to a T!  It has a crispy exterior due to the parmasan crusting... and its delish!  Oh and if you order a steak... you can order any way, any sauce, peppered, etc.... pretty much it seems if you ask they most likely can do.  Just the way you like it! They also have live jazz playing in the bar area... very nice touch.","date":"2013-09-04 01:20:12"}

Apparently you can only do pay by the hour if you're a pro. We chose the non smoking side and there were 2-3 other tables being used at the time. The jukebox was surprisingly really good until someone chose to play their own tunes. We did end up smelling like cigarette smoke afterwards. Not sure if this is from hanging out in the smoking area initially or if it's so overpowering that it gets into the non smoking area. They also have shuffleboard and a few carnival style games like skee ball. Knowing that most any billiards hall in Vegas is going to be equally smoky I think I'd rather come here and know your chances of getting a table are pretty good and they're at least attempting to offer a non smoking option.","date":"2018-10-04 17:47:38"}

It's a great way to give back and get some neat freebies, movie and Penn & Teller tickets, Amazon gift cards, blood donation promotional and \"hero in you\" t-shirts. :)\n\nThe West Charleston site is the UBS I've donated to for many years. Location is within 15 minutes from home and has great parking. I am thrilled they now have a questionnaire they email me the day of my donation so I can jam through it while having my morning cup of joe. \n\nI love Mimi when I donate platelets. The other phlebotomists not so much. Last Sunday went and had an unsuccessful donation and a bruise for four days from my stick. I will only donate from this point forward when she's working. She knows me by name, happy, bright, sunny disposition, always has a loving presence and checks up on me throughout my 1-1\/2 hour platelets donation process. Afterwards there are always lots of different juices in the frig, oatmeal raisin and chocolate chip cookies, Oreos, nuts and wheat thins. I actually raid the canteen area BEFORE my donation when I have to sit get my vitals done (BP, temp, pulse, iron). Due to being a pescetarian, my iron usually teeters on the 12.5 mark.\n\nPlease donate! We need more people to give in Vegas.","date":"2015-12-20 21:43:58"}

However, it paled in comparison to many of the 2-starred venues.  The prices are obscene first of all - about double what I've grown accustomed to paying for a  similar experience (even the champagne).  Not to mention, the bites and bubbles menu at Guy Savoy we had tackled two nights prior was MUCH more affordable and more enjoyable.\n\nOur standard 5 course menu began with what was really  an oversized amuse bouche, a chopped apple with spices served in a glass wrapped with pictures of apples.  Good but not worthy of being called an appetizer.  The next dish was cold, shaved foie gras and thin slices of black truffles arranged in a salad.  The truffle slices were old or improperly stored and had absolutely no flavor.  I absolutely love truffles and should have sent it back; huge disappointment.  The foie gras was excellent however.  \n\nThe main courses were a boring fish cooked in a unneccesarily huge iron pot and some wagyu steak.  The quality of the steak was amazing, much like the one time I've had authentic prime wagyu before where I was charged far less for the pleasure. \n\n The one saving grace of the meal was dessert..  The presentation of a shiny, glittery ball that melted upon contact with a warm sauce was spectacular.  The dessert trolley offered a wide selection of expertly prepared mignardises.  The free take-home box of chocolates was a nice touch.    Service was great but not exceptional and the tables were packed too closely.  \n\nOverall, Robuchon is hardly deserving of 3 michelin stars based on our one experience, though your mileage may vary .  I feel that it was all style over substance and that may be fine for fashion bu not for food.  At half the price, I'd have been more forgiving (3-4 stars), but I felt cheated and given the many other excellent restaurants in Vegas, I don't feel there's any reason to visit Robuchon.  And I say this having gone in with a very positive attitutide after dining at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon in Paris, which was exceptional all around.  If you do go to Robuchon, my one piece of advice is to go a la cart, which I didn't realize was an option and seemed almost reasonable.","date":"2009-10-13 15:01:50"}

It's close to home and convenient for a quick bite. Food is very good. We've only tried the Mahi Mahi and fish n chips, but recommend both. Prices are pretty resonable for the area and not much different than any other restaurant. Service is a hit and miss. The young gals working there are mostly very friendly and attentive with an occasional employee not wanting to put much effort into work. That doesn't compromise the food however. The one thing that took me by surprise on my last visit was watching a gentleman pick up the wash rag off of the FLOOR behind the cash register and start wiping tables with it. When we were leaving I asked the gal at the counter who the manager was and she said well he's the owner and pointed to the very gentleman that picked up the washrag and wiped tables. I said to him, \"I just watched you picked up the wash rag off the floor and start wiping down the tables.\" I'm sure (or hope) he teaches his staff restaurant cleanliness. You can tell he was embarrassed  (which was not my intent at all), but he did apologize. I think he will be more conscious going forward. I DO NOT WANT THIS TO DISCOURAGE ANYONE FROM EATING AT THIS RESTAURANT AS THE FOOD IS REALLY GOOD AND WE WILL DEFINITELY CONTINUE EATING THERE.

We raced with a super-groupon deal so that our family of 4 had 2 races each. \n\nThe kids started with the junior carts and that was the right call as neither really had much experience driving carts (Mario Kart doesn't count) so they were a bit cautious at first. However, in their second race they put the pedal to the metal and tested the limits of their speed-limited carts.\n\nThe adults took the big carts for a run and I was lucky to be racing with novices and took the checkered flag in one of the two races. I was foiled by a \"pile up\" in one of the races which killed my lap average. :) My lovely wife took a nice stroll around the course and it was fun to wave as I zipped by.\n\nThe service was excellent. The track-workers were hilarious. All in all a great experience. \n\n** note ** Our first attempt to race was marred by the company Groupon and their multi-hour outage in March 2015. We did not print the groupon, we couldn't pull it up on our phones, and they had no way to help us over the phone (30+ min wait to tell us that).

She got our older daughter some stickers to play with, and they even had a saddle bag up front with goodies in it that the kids got to pick from. She mentioned that it's a very family-oriented business, and that was very clear in how the kids were treated as guests, not just accessories of their parents. I love it when businesses embrace kids!\nThe food was also top-notch, and arrived to the table quickly. I had the Eggs Benedict, and loved their thick, buttery Hollandaise sauce. Their breakfast potatoes were also very good. My husband had a skillet meal that looked great, and I stole a bite of his toast with house-made jam, that was seriously soooo good. \nThe service, food, and atmosphere at Lone Spur were all great, and we will definitely make a return trip in the future to try some of their other offerings!

I have received sports massages, Swedish and deep tissue. I consider La Vida to be a very good facility and Angel to be a very competent therapist. For more than 6 months I have gone once every 3-4 weeks.\n\nI work out regularly and consider a massage a great way to heal sore muscles and low back pain from sitting at a desk all day. After my old therapist moved to Florida, I began the annoying process of trying new ones. Some have trouble dialing up or down the pressure. Some can't get the low back pain out like others. Some reek of cigarette smoke. Some are lazy, using one hand at a time instead of two.\n\nThen I found Angel, who is quite competent. If you wanna chat, she'll chat. If you want quiet relaxation, she'll put you at ease. If you say \"I hurt here\", she will solve it. I consider one of Angel's attributes to be the fact she can dial up or down pressure just BARELY, and maintain that. She can find where it hurts and, due to her through knowledge of fascia and layers of tissue, massage the pain away. After repeat sessions, she understands I need more pressure on the right side of my spine than my left. Angel's ability to meet her clients needs combined with her through knowledge of muscle and fascia along with the ability to maintain consistent pressure make her an extremely competent therapist.\n\nIf Angel is busy or sick, Ivan is a fantastic alternative. He's an A in my book, with Angel an A+. Edit: Forgot to mention, Ivan's strengths are deep tissue and neck work. If your neck specifically is killing you or you need real deep tissue, Ivan is your man.\n\nLa Vida is an upper middle \/ yuppie chain massage location with ample parking. I feel strongly that these are superior to middle brow chain massage places (such as Massage Envy) and superior to upscale spas (such as Sewickly or Seven Springs or Esspa). Simply put, La Vida has lots of returning clients and as such, a steady stream of business and competent and calm massage therapists with little turnover.","date":"2014-02-05 20:28:23"}

Thus, we actually PREFER a hotel with no casino in it. I got a Travelzoo rate several months ago for $109\/nt for a King Suite with a view.\n\nWhen we arrived, check-in was VERY efficient and speedy. Our room was on the 55th floor and we had a view straight down the Strip. The room was spacious and had a well-equipped kitchenette (including Sub Zero mini fridge, Bosch microwave and Cuisinart toaster and blender). The bathroom had a huge marble shower and separate Jacuzzi bathtub, double marble sinks and a flatscreen TV INSIDE of the mirror! The furnishings are very clean and modern and the room felt luxurious.\n\nThe best part of the entire room was the bed! It was easily the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in -- IN MY LIFE! The front desk told me they are made by Stearns & Foster specially for Mr. Trump, but that he thinks something similar is available through the company. The sheets were high TC and the pillows and comforter were lofty and plump. The hotel also offers a 4 p.m. late checkout for no additional charge, which was perfect since we were out until 4 a.m. the night before.\n\nMy complaints are extremely minor: no call-down service for the valet (but the wait was usually only about 10 minutes), no free WiFi ($12\/day is a little steep and I felt it should have been included), no additional toiletries like mouthwash or toothpaste and the shampoo\/conditioner wasn't very high quality. Boyfriend also thought there should be some sort of rubber mat for the shower, since it was all marble and was very slippery once wet. My only other comment is that the lobby is a little bit gauche (but, it's Vegas...what lobby isn't?!).\n\nAll in all, I thought this was a FANTASTIC value and, as I said, the best bed I've experienced in my life. I will definitely be back.\n\np.s. in response to those who say it's \"off the Strip,\" it's not. It's on the older part of the Strip (near Circus Circus), but it's not technically \"off-Strip.\"  Also, when it's 110 degrees outside, I don't know who is actually WALKING from casino to casino, anyway!!!

She was also drunk and smelled strongly of alcohol. Not that I care if you're drinking but perhaps that altered her mood.","date":"2016-12-04 04:19:27"}

Loved staying offstrip for a quieter experience.   \n\nThe good:.\n\n Staff are great (see exception below).   Most staff here were fabulous.  The check in was smooth, the valet staff are lovely, one of the cleaning staff even offered to wait for me to get my Starbucks when she saw me hesitating to leave the guest access only area because I forgot my card. \n\nThe amenities here are awesome!  The pools are gorgeous and one pool has a sand bottom portion with a sand beach.   \n\nThe only thing I will say needs to change is the pool staff.   For the most part the wait staff was okay but could definitely improve but what I found awful were the lifeguards.   The first day we were at the pool three lifeguards just talked amongst themselves and bottle flipped to keep themselves busy. Yes, bottle flipped - my 8 year kids favorite game.  There was even a point where a young child in the pool went face down in the water and the adult with them didn't notice and guess what? Neither did the lifeguards.   No kidding someone is going to die on their watch if they continue like this.  The second day here it was two lifeguards having a bromance looking at each other the whole time instead of at the pool.  I get that it's not that busy but it's a job that has some dangerous consequences if you aren't doing your job even for a moment.  Instead they were passing a life float between them for fun, talking about picking girls up at the bar to the point my husband had to leave becauae he didn't want to here their childish talk anymore.   \n\nOtherwise a fantastic stay.

Whole wheat or white.\n\nI know many of the counter people who work at T Hortons are immigrants working for min wage and they are working long hours, but have a bit of empathy!

NEAT and FUN for that dog, but was a little distracting to my dogs, who wanted to eat that yappy little....)\nOnly trouble I had: \nonce you're down the road a bit further south on Central, you are moving past various houses, estates, and condominiums, and are no longer near any of those restaurants up near Dunlap, however there is a distinct odor of DIRTY SPENT FRYER GREASE all up and down the path.  I wonder if the city sprays a petroleum product on the unpaved path to keep dust down?  I hope not; they did that on my street as a kid in Detroit, and anyone who walked on it barefoot got blisters, cracking, and peeling skin.  Blech!  Even if I lived near here, I'd rather have the dust, and I don't want that on my dogs feet, either. One reason I'd use this path in the summer is that with all the nice sized shade trees, you don't need to get your dog booties.  \nPick up after your dogs.  What's with the people who tie it up in a baggie, but then leave the baggie?","date":"2009-05-19 23:51:15"}

TWICE!  A great place for beer geeks!  They have their entire line-up of current beers to choose from and an excellent little store that you can purchase bombers and interesting things like Trois Pistoles Mustard, Blance De Chambly Orange Marmalade, and Trois Pistoles Blackberry Jam (we purchased all three of these and they are all delicious)!\n\nWe hit the restaurant at a weird time (around 4pm) on this trip and they had a limited menu.  We did a meat and cheese plate to go along with a Sampler (3 ounces of Blanche De Chambly, Ephemere [Seasonal], Blonde De Chambly, Noire De Chambly, La Fin Du Monde, and Trois Pistoles) and Seigneuriale for me and an Ephemere Cerise (Cherry) for my wife.  A minor setback was that four of the six beers in my sampler came out of the bottle instead of the tap, so only two of them had that super-fresh taste, but it was still good nonetheless.  I would recommend finding out what is on draft and sticking with those, though, because those beers will rank among the best beers you will ever have in your life.\n\nRestaurant atmosphere was beautiful.  When we went during the summer, it felt like a lovely cottage house on the lake.  When it was cold in October, it felt like a rustic ski lodge just getting ready for the snow.  Service was very courteous.  We practiced our French this time (as there were some language barriers on the first visit) but both of our servers spoke excellent English.\n\nDefinitely recommended to swing through on your way up to Montreal.  Even if you're heading to Quebec City, it's not difficult to get to, just a long trip after you leave.  If you're heading back to the US, just remember that you'll be dealing with the border about a half-hour after leaving and that might not work out too well.  Please note that we were able to purchase Unibroue shirts on our first trip through but we heard a rumor that no more clothes were being produced.  I hope they change their mind on that one!  Also, be sure to check their hours before making the drive as they have limited hours during Chambly's slower months.","date":"2013-10-24 14:28:42"}

I love everyone I interacted with thus far at Gateway! I have two dogs - one loves everyone (so this was easy for him) and the other is ... a little more hesitant. When I came in, the lobby seemed pretty busy (they were getting low on seating, but not out) and I took a number. I was seen less than 30 minutes later, and never felt like my wait was too long.\n\nWhen I was taken back, there are tables set up, where the vets and vet techs come talk with you and help your pet. You're not in a separate room (like my old vet). This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I think for one of my dogs it was better because while he got blood drawn and a vaccine, he was too distracted to care - there was (what looked like a) lab\/pit mix across the room who may have at one point looked at him! How interesting! and that golden over there! What's that smell behind me?\n\nEveryone that works there is friendly, and they work quickly. Since they work rather quickly, don't expect to sit down and have a long conversation. They get to the point, and then send you on your way because there are twenty more dogs to be seen. I never felt rushed though.\n\nIf you own pets, you know that they can be expensive. Even small expenses add up quickly. I ended up at Gateway because I priced out my annual vet trip at my old vet and cringed. A lot. I called around and checked out a few other places. I felt like Goldilocks. One vet was a little cheaper, but the staff seemed to hate their jobs and maybe me. Another vet was more expensive but seemed nice. Gateway? Gateway was just right. Gateway didn't offer me any discount, yet I felt like I got two for the price of one (I paid what I would have for just one dog at my old place). My dogs got their vaccines for the next year plus(heartworm and rabies), as well as kennel cough, and one of my dogs got microchipped. Previously I was told that the kennel cough vaccine is given every other year as a shot, and every other nasal - but Gateway had oral. That was so much easier on both of my dogs! One of my dogs is a pug, so the nasal was unpleasant for him and I (on the plus side, last year I got the vaccine as well - since he sprayed it all over me). \n\nBoth of my dogs seemed well cared for while I was there, and got plenty of love. The microchipped dog seemed neutral (and wouldn't take any treats from the vet tech after she took him to get microchipped), but he pug LOVED it. I practically had to drag him out of there. Being so incredibly busy, you'd expect Gateway to be a circus, but it was run pretty smoothly. I hope I won't be back until next year, but I know that regardless they'll take excellent care of us.","date":"2013-05-08 05:19:03"}

I have spent over 1000 dollars and still not finished from 6+k in damages from the estimate on my car that I left there on a Wednesday afternoon and Geico estimated 15 days to repair it and then was told it was done the next Tues.morning. Corners cut? Anyone with half of a brain would agree. I asked where's my new rim damaged in the accident? Oh sorry here is another Geico adjuster present standing next to my car. Owner says my adjuster Tom Fletcher is an asshole and that the guy present standing next to my car was fair and he said he would get me a rim. And the owner also promised the rim regardless and when I asked how much more to do some touch up paint work he said FREE! Long as I would bring my business to them, from now on. \n     He surely noticed that my inspection was up soon as he promised me BOTH! Then I NEVER heard another word from them again since Dec.2016. And still have not been able to afford to fix all of the damage done in the accident that they overlooked due to quick in and out. I had to buy a new battery 3 days later when my car wouldn't start. Whatever mechanic worked on my car forgot to plug in the power cord to my new radiator cooling fan and my car overheated and had to spend money to get a diagnosis why it was overheating and was a simple wire not plugged in. So also proof it was never even tested to see if the new fan worked . This was a front end collision and then I had and still have a loud clicking sound coming from my front wheel where the rim wasn't replaced.  When I took it elsewhere for inspection soon after due to no reply from multiple messages left for the owner gone without a reply? Rather than bother with them after speaking with an ex-employee, I realized I was screwed.  So then I had a broken tie rod not noticed or added to my estimate and anyone knows you need an alignment when you replace a tie rod so another 300 bucks total. \n    But still have the clicking noise or loud tapping and my friend said it's either The CV joint or a bent control arm. But couldn't tell without it on a lift . So now will end up spending a fortune to finally get my car back to perfect operating condition like it was before one of their tow truck drivers just happened to be standing there in downtown Pittsburgh during rush hour with a walkie.  Waiting to prey on me. But I still haven't gotten to the most corrupt part.  Geico paid them from my estimate to recharge my A.C. since it was obvious that it was routine when my radiator, cooling fan, and coolant tank were all destroyed. But guess what happened when I went to actually USE my A.C. a couple months later once winter broke? Hot air. So I took it to Ryan's Auto\/Goodyear in Moon. Twp., and explained everything to them. They said well I can't imagine they would have not recharged your system with refrigerant.  So I paid for a diagnosis and dye ran thru the system and nice of them to only charge me 75 bucks and guess what? Cold air!!! NO LEAKS! SO THEY NEVER EVEN RECHARGED MY A.C. Crooks! And guess what else ? I AM AN UBER DRIVER FOR 2PLUS YEARS NOW AND UBER HAS THEIR TEST TRACK BLOCKS AWAY FROM THIS SHOP IN HAZELWOOD JUST BEHIND THE RAILROAD TRACKS!

I've been to the one in Thousand Oaks, CA a few times and thought I would give this location a try. It is located in the Crystals shopping plaza that is next to the Aria hotel. This place is really nice and you feel a little bit underdressed if you aren't in your Sunday best. \n\nI made reservations ahead of time but the place didn't looked too packed for a Saturday night. We had a nice table an attentive waiter. We got our drinks pretty quickly and the martinis were strong.  There was some live music being heard from the lounge area near the bar area which had a nice touch to it. \n\nI still went with the meat selection even though this was the Ocean Club. My boyfriend and I both had petite which is served on a searing hot plate. The meat continues to cook on the plate and just easily cuts like butter. The steak just melts in your mouth as the seasoning of the meat and light butter from the plate meet in your mouth, I call it Meaty Symphonic Harmony. \n\nWe also ordered the sweet potato fries as a side. This is no mere small side dish but a mound of fries is delivered. Each fry is seasoned with an almost tempura like batter on the outside that leaves you craving more and more. I was stuffed after the filet and the fries and the yummy bread basket they bring you (with warm pretzel bread and other goodies). \n\nDessert is something that just can't be missed and I suggest the sinful delight of the signature Warm Butter Cake and whipped cream. The butter cake is rich and heavy with deliciousness and the whipped cream is no ordinary whipped cream. It almost has the consistency of ice cream as it hits your palate. \nThis is my treat for the year, it is expensive so be warned but it is also a high class meal. I highly recommend it.","date":"2012-12-04 20:43:19"}

He screeched his tires and cursed, but I think that's rare behavior in the midwest. Perhaps he was from New York. \n\nThe house is great - you can walk up on the front porch and look in the back where Ralphie shot his eye out. Museum was really just a store.

The day of the reservation the driver was a little late, but they called to let us know, which was much appreciated.

Prior to this, my closest convenient neighborhood market was Rollin's Market with its rotting bell peppers and frozen Banquet dinners.  There's always Fry's or Safeway, but I like hitting up a small little market on the corner of my neighborhood and build a rapport with the employees and owners as part of establishing a community.\n\nThe dude who runs the place will sometimes thrown in a tomato or apple or lime in with your bag of groceries.  Hey, free apple.  \n\nNot everything they have is permanent.  Sometimes something new will be there, and the next week it will be gone, but in a way, I like that about it.  You go in there, and they have these Indian pickles made from wild cucumbers.  Next week, in its place, will be garlic pickles or something else awesome.\n\nFor what the place is, it's marvelous.  It's a little place and about as un-ghetto as it gets.  It's nice having a little market where you can pop in and buy polish sausage from a local farmer, organic soup, goat cheese with kalamata olives but you can also get your regular ass Skippy peanut butter and Campbell's soup.","date":"2010-01-08 18:58:51"}

I've been eating at this place for at least the past 13 years.

Oh, how I miss my chicken quesadillas since I went vegetarian. Delicious grilled chicken, cheese, tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, sour cream, and then add some of their amazing mild salsa, and you'll seriously be in heaven.  My dad is a huge fan of their machaca burrito, and he's pretty picky when it comes to machaca. So I'd have to trust him and believe that it's pretty darn good.\n\nThey also have a decent beer selection (Mexican beer of course), with margaritas available too. Free bowl of warm chips and freshly made salsa with every meal, lunch or dinner for under $10 and at least two locations (Bell Rd. and Glendale Rd.).","date":"2010-03-12 23:19:45"}

Also, you probably shouldn't say it to someone when you don't know what their budget is or how much they are willing to pay. Moreover, the condescending, rude tone in which you say things like that have a lasting effect. \n\nThey don't know that they are on the preferred vendor's list at my venue, they don't know specific rules or things that the venue already provides and this girl seems to have no grasp of how to get details from someone without asking the most idiotic questions.

Heck yeah I'll take it! Ordering through a phone call or going in would be better. Put my order and a couple co workers order in online and paid. 25 bucks gone. Another co worker left to get the food and went to the counter to pick up order. Luckily he made it just as it started filling up with people. The employee at the counter didn't have any idea what he was talking about when he said he was there for an online order pickup.

I get it, sometimes technology doesn't work right and you get missed. They realized and said sorry and made the order quickly. Now for the food.. we were all excited to try this place as it was new for us all. Every single item we ordered was made incorrectly.

West Covina, CA location is better if you're in the area.\n\nHainan chicken - chicken was soft, but they left out the best part - the chicken juice.  I love it when they pour that stuff all over the rice.  (I say juice so it sounds healthier than say, 'oily chicken essence.'  Also, if you want really good Hainan chicken rice and you happen to be in Alhambra, CA, go here: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/savoy-kitchen-alhambra#hrid:8nuOzJJQDsKa9NK-WhJsbQ\/src:search\/query:hainan%20chicken)  \n\nSome sort of egg tofu - pretty good, but really heavy.  Don't order it unless you're hungry or you really know how to scarf protein.  \n\nRoti canai - Must try for Malaysian cuisine it seems.  Crepe\/pancake style bread that you dip in curry.  The curry was good, don't remember what kind it was.  I don't think it was served hot enough, though.  It got cold too quickly.  My mom said the bread wasn't as good as their location West Covina.  \n\nChicken satay - Really light appetizer.   They give you really small, thin strips of chicken.  Don't expect this to be in any way filling (unless you decide to pour the peanut sauce all over your rice, and you just might be because that sauce is so sweet and delicious.  Almost sweet enough to be a dessert.)","date":"2010-01-08 03:17:23"}

Foodwise, it was good but I'd expect that from a place like this.  I ordered one of their Mixup lunches which gives you a salad option, a protein and a side.  I ordered the mixed green salad, the porcini mushroom and pepper encrusted strip and an order of carmelized cauliflower as a side.\n\nThe strip was amazing.  It came sliced over a layer of steak sauce.  It was cooked perfectly.  The salad was ok....mixed greens with tomatoes, blue cheese and a dressing that I still do not recognize.  The cauliflower came in a mound.  Honestly, this had to be 1\/2 to 2\/3 of the head of cauliflower.  It was seasoned with capers and other herbs.  While the taste was good, the quantity was entirely too much and I could only eat half.\n\nThe decor of the place is as you would expect with a lot of medium to dark wood but it just didn't do anything for me.

I wish I could remember my tech's name 'cause she was just as nice and courteous - just remember it starting with a D. She let me fully explain my iPhone problem, then she walked me through diagnosing with their speakers. She literally could tell that the difference I had with it compared to hers. Before trying to replace my phone, she wanted to know if I had any questions for her and I brought up how I bought the device from my cell provider. Not wanting to cause any problems with them, she wrote me a notice to bring to them just in case they wanted proof that the device needed to be replaced. All courteous and thoughtful. \nOther than my experience, I can commend them on trying to accommodate\/help a mom and her 2 kids. The little brother overheard the patron say she had the wrong appointment time, but she had been waiting for awhile and had other appointments elsewhere. Before they could get to me, they helped her out first. Her tech was nice, trying to be personable with her and the kids while diagnosing the problem. Took him about 10-15 minutes to help her out, hopeful that she'd make it to their other engagements on time, and thankful for her patience.","date":"2015-12-20 19:38:27"}

It was crowded when we arrived, and the host snapped at us saying it would be another 30 minutes for our reservation. I asked if we could go to the bar while we wait, and she said there was no room there either.  So we went to a Casino bar & came back 30 minutes later, and the manager told us it'd be at least another 30 minutes.  They weren't at all polite, they acted like we were being a pain for coming back. SERIOUSLY?!  So I asked them to take my number down & call me when the table was ready, and she begrudgingly did.

However, when the bartender at the awesome strip mall wine bar told me about this place you could get buggalo of food for less than a five spot, I was sold.  \n\nCook Out is an anomaly among fast food places in that its menu has everything you could ever want, or at least everything I could ever want (sans corn nuggets).  Cook Out offers the boring old hamburger thing but don't let that distract you- opt for the BBQ.  For less than $5, you get your own picnic.  \n\nMy plate had a hockey puck sized portion of pulled pork, a couple fingers of hush puppies, fries, and slaw. The chronic pulled pork was super moist considering it was 1 AM, and came topped with Texas Pete's.  Although it was delicious, isn't Carolina BBQ supposed to be heavy on the sauce?  The hush puppies were okay (more breading than bread), and the fries forgettable.  When it comes to cole slaw, I am a snob but Cook Out's slaw was surprisingly good; it was house made and very dry, but I mean that in a good way.   It's also worth mentioning that you can get a corn dog as a side.  I don't know why, but as a Southern gentleman, I agree with and salute that.  \n\nHow Cook Out really let me get my jollies was the drink menu.  Cheerwine- my god, if I ever make a lot of money I'm putting a fountain of that crack drank in my house.  If you're from out of town, drink up because that stuff can only be found in North Carolina.  They also have about 40 different kinds of milkshakes available, including seasonal ones.  The winter shake is eggnog but apparently they only have that one in December.  The fact that they have a watermelon shake in the summer blows my mind.  Be warned though, the shakes are thick like a Petey Pablo video girl- you'll need a spoon, or at least a boba tea straw.  \n\nAs I said, the idea of a fast food BBQ joint just doesn't do it for me, but Cook Out pulls together the concept beautifully.  It's like if Jesus and Allah got along and then made a baby.  A beautiful mixed baby named Cook Out.","date":"2008-12-03 04:07:28"}

The decor was fun and playful, making you feel very comfortable.\n\nThe guacamole was outstanding (we ate the entire thing) along with their tortilla soup and salsa verde.  The shrimp enchiladas were enjoyed on my second visit, those too were phenomenal.  Their food has a balance of spice and flavor without being overly salty.  Their tequila selection is killer.  If you enjoy good tequila this is your spot, they have just about everything you want and a few you may not have heard of yet.  \n\nYou have to be sure to get a picture on the swing next to the bar.  It's a fun photo op and a great way to remember the place.  La Comida makes a great first date spot, especially if you want to see how your date holds their alcohol.

What I wasn't prepared for was run down and dirty. First of all, it's very easy to miss this place, we drove by it twice as it's wedged in between two other businesses and there is not a single hotel person (i.e. valet) waiting outside. We ended up having to call the front desk and ask where we were supposed to park the car to unload our bags. She seemed confused by this request and after a few minutes she told us just to leave the car in the service entrance behind the hotel. Weird! What hotel doesn't have some sort of established valet system for their guests arriving in cars. \n\nCheck in was fine and the staff was nice but I knew as I walked in this wasn't going to work out. The lobby was super small. It was cramped with four people waiting at the front desk. We were told we had been upgraded to a junior suite, so I was hopeful the room at least would be nice. The elevator was dark and dingy and barely fit two people with luggage. \n\nAs soon as we got to the room, the few hopes I had left were dashed. The room size was nice but it was just....dingy. The bed was lumpy, everything from the curtains to the dust ruffle were wrinkled and stained. The linoleum was cracked, the burner carpet looked like it had been there for roughly a hundred years. Needless to stay, we checked out immediately and headed to the W Hotel. I would highly recommend staying somewhere else unless this is your only option.","date":"2013-08-03 15:29:18"}

This helped a lot since my husband and I are not all that familiar with Malaysian cuisine.   \n\nWe ordered the roti canai, a stir fry vegetable dish with shrimp paste (similar to chinese spinach, ong choy), a spicy curry chicken, and a rice noodle stir fry.  All of the dishes were delicious.   The roti was light, flaky, and hot.  The accompanying curry dipping sauce was the perfect vehicle for sopping up the yummy sauce.  So flavorful and spicy.  The vegetable stir fry and noodle dishes were also tasty.  The star of the show, however was the curry chicken.  OMG!  I wish I had a second stomach to eat more of that dish.

It was hard but the inside was soft and tasted fresh. The butter was kinda hard too, the jam was pretty good and the ketchup I guess was for the fries to come? Who eats bread with ketchup?\n\nCheese Danish - Looked like a croissant shaped like a muffin, with a dab of some cream cheese butter on top. This was So Flaky\/Soft and the cream cheese butter lightly spread throughout was perfectly balanced.. This wasn't your ordinary cheese danish (pre-packaged grocery store bought), this thing was Superb!\n\nCroque Madame: Toasted ham & cheese on brioche with a fried egg & mornay sauce. Served with pommes frites.. Sounded quite fancy for a breakfast dish - In Layman's Terms = Ham & Cheese Sandwich with Egg and Fries! Toast tasted like a really buttered croissant with an airy texture. Ham & Cheese wasn't the oscar mayer ham nor Kraft cheese I use for h&c sandwiches back at home, it was much more gourmealicous! Plus, with the fried egg, more like a sunny side up egg and their white creamy\/frothy sauce, makes an Incredible Sandwich! Fries were served as a generous amount and were plain good. \n\nCorned Beef Hash with eggs and toast: Corned Beef hash came in shallow bowl with a blanket of overeasy eggs practically covering the hash. I scooted over the eggs to try just the flavor of the corned beef. They were little cubed chunks sitting on top of some pretty tasty juice\/sauce. The cubes tasted and had the texture of ham. The juice\/sauce gave it a great beef flavor but not the usual Real and typical corned beef I'm used to having. Nevertheless, it was Good. The toast were thick and had a buttery flavor and reminded me of a Crouton.

To me, it's ok. As long as you do a good job I don't mind buying from a copy cat. Saryo is a 2 in 1 shop with ramen (Konjiki) and the Saryo café. This review is for Saryo.\n\nI'm a matcha fiend and have to politely disagree with all the other reviewers praising Saryo's matcha. It really doesn't compare with Tsujiri. Tsujiri has a much longer history of doing matcha and Saryo's matcha is simply not the same grade. High quality matcha is supposed to have a subtle sweetness in addition to a slight bitter taste. Too bitter does not mean it's better. Saryo's matcha soft serve is simply not as pronounced and lacks that subtle sweetness I would expect. The texture is also a bit more runny than I would like. \n\nAlso, their selection is much smaller than Tsujiri and most of the pastry items are a notch worse than Tsujiri. \n\nCustomer service wise, I can't get over one of their servers. It's a guy named Taiki I think. Horrible service. If you want good matcha drinks and desserts, definitely go to Tsujiri instead. Prices are about the same but you get less quality at Saryo.

So, a change in food was very much needed. My co-workers mentioned this restaurant a while ago. Today, I decided to feed my culinary curiosity and order lunch for my co-worker (aka my lunch homie) and I. Harry's Grill and Tavern, here we come! Here are some of the items that we ordered :\n\nMapleleaf Farms Duck Wings w\/Bourbon BBQ sauce and Jicama Slaw\n\n1) Initially, the chicken looked a little parched. Last night's chicken? Ummm, I hope not. However, the taste was decent. Portion size was good. \n\n2) The Jicama slaw was an excellent take on slaw. Traditional slaw (cabbage) can sometimes become very boring. However, the Jicama put a nice spin on it. The lunch homie, though, with her traditionalist, non-risk taking tongue, let the slaw fall gently from her mouth. You can't please every palate.  \n\nSmall Mixed Green Salad with Raspberry Vinaigrette and Mac - N - Cheese - Lunch Combo\n\n1) Harry's Mac - N - Cheese was the greatest joy that I experienced during this meal! The consistency and texture was great...not too dry and not loose...just creamy goodness in my belly! The levels of cheesiness was outstanding. And the light sprinkling of panko crumbs provided that last bit of contrast and crunch. The Comfort Food gods have bestowed their blessings on this particular dish.\n\n2) Bought the Small Mixed Green salad to eat for dinner. The portion size definitely small, but it's packed with some good stuff. Can't wait to get my greedy hands on it later this evening!\n \nHarry Old Fashioned Burger with a side of Sweet Potato Fries\n\n1) My lunch homie ordered a Harry's Old Fashion Burger with a side order of sweet potato fries. I snagged a few and they were good. I've ordered sweet potato fries at other establishments and I've always needed additional condiments (i.e. Honey Mustard sauce)  to add some taste. However, we both agreed that these fries were great by themselves. The slight sweetness of vanilla gave the side item a little more depth, while the salt reminds you that it's still a fry.\n\nShe was less enthusiastic about her burger, though. I believed she said that she had better times with a BK Whopper. Hey, I'm not a burger connoisseur,  so who am I to judge? The presentation of the burger was well put together. Wasn't sloppy or unappealing. Just your typical pub burger waiting to be consumed.\n\nAll items were moderately priced. My tab totaled to 31.12. Our lunch take out order was timely ( ready in 15 minutes) and accurate. Great location and if you're a non-parallel parker such as myself, they have easy access to the restaurant from the parking garage.  I will definitely return to see what Harry's has to offer for dinner and brunch. I must try the Lobster Mac - N - Cheese!!!","date":"2016-07-14 20:03:15"}

Read a couple of reviews and they seemed fair enough to give it a try. Got the steak sandwich with provolone and mushrooms. Was okay, not much flavor in the meat. I will add as well this place is a bit pricey for what you get , $11.00 for a full sub and a drink is kinda high. Over all it was good, I'd say the best was the bread, soft and fresh can't ever go wrong with that. Would I return, probably not, if they adjust the prices and have more lunch specials that are worth the travel then I probably say I would come back and try many other subs.  At least a daily special from 11-2, maybe $7-8 bucks for a 6 inch, soup and a med drink.

So we took a seat inside only to find 2 groups had left the patio 10 minutes later.  We would have waited for a patio seat if we had the option as it was a lovely night.  \n\nWhen we were greeted by our waiter he told us that we could only order off the summerlicious menu.  But throughout the night, we saw many people ordering burgers (that were not on the summerlicious menu), so I'm not sure why everyone other than us could order off the regular menu...?\n\nFood: 2\/5\nI had the buttermilk fried chicken as an appetizer and it was good.  My food rating would have been 1 if not for the appetizer.  My boyfriend got the duck buns and said my appetizer was better.  The main course was the maple baby back ribs.  I was looking forward to these all day and was very disappointed.  They were way too spicy and not cooked very well.  Ribs should be falling off the bone if cooked properly - these definitely were not! There was also no plate for the bones or wet naps for us - but that has nothing to do with the food, but more to do with the service.  For dessert I had the brownie ice cream cake and my boyfriend had blue berry pie.  The pie had no taste and was infinitely better than my cake.  The brownie part was so hard that I couldn't cut into it with my spoon.  After two bites (my b\/f had to cut it for me!) I decided it wasn't worth the effort - and thereby made history, as it was the first time I've EVER declined a dessert!\n\nOther:\nThe restaurant was nice inside but not nice enough for me to return.","date":"2014-07-13 14:26:10"}

I want to be fair. We will start with the good stuff.\nWe stayed here back in June 2017. We, my husband and I, were going to Las Vegas for combination of Honeymoon and my husbands 40th Birthday. We invited some friends to join us. We ended up with about 20 of us there. We didnt all stay at the Flamingo. Only 6 of us did. Others stayed in time shares and other hotels. We are platinum members so we got to skip the long line, That was great. We chose the Flamingo because it was iconic. We knew it was a bit older and less expensive so we really were prepared for less fancy than other places. We were ok with that. Good thing too since our mini suite was quite run down and not very clean. Housekeeping obviously needs some training. But we didnt really mind. We had the Birthday party at Carlos and Charlies with all 20 of us. It was great and our waiter , Jason, was the best. We rented a cabana at the Go pool which was pretty nice but the mister in the cabana didnt work and just dripped water all over our stuff. Between my Husband and I and the rest of our party we spent many thousands of dollars. We had saved so we could do anything and everything we wanted and we did. It was great. At the point of getting our bags out of the room and heading down to check out I probably would have given them 4 stars. Quite pleased with the experience to this point....\nAnd that was the point where we discovered that the staff at The Flamingo did not want us to have happy memories. At the check out kiosk we discovered a charge of just over a thousand dollars that we didnt understand. We went to the front desk and were told that someone in housekeeping had gone into our room and noticed sleeping bags and enough luggage for about 6 extra people. -First of all, our do not disturb sign was up the entire time so no one was supposed to go in there at all.-  I told her that was a lie and we wouldnt pay it. She went in the back to talk to a manager and came out with out the manager and with no solution. She called housekeeping and was told the supervisor was not available but that they had pictures to prove it. I asked to see the pictures. They never could supply them. We had to leave to catch a plane but didnt pay. We had agreed with the front desk lady that it would be left as pending until the problem was resolved. After weeks of calling and getting no returned phone calls. Total run around. They never supplied us with pictures. It was a horrible experience. We found out we could contact Ceasars Customer Service so we did. They did call us back and said the charge had been removed. No sorry, No admitting they had made a mistake. It was more like just take it off to get us to shut up. So we dropped it because the charge was removed but never made happy. We will stay at Ceasars properties but never at the Flamingo again.\nI hope  it was worth it for you -Flamingo- to try to screw us out of $1000 because I can promise that no one in our 20 person party, many of which are Las Vegas regulars, or anyone any of us ever talk to about it will stay at your hotel. Ceasars is lucky that we love their other properties so much, especially Paris.","date":"2017-08-16 13:59:00"}

We get there and they put my husband and 70 year old dad right in the middle of traffic.  In a very claustrophobic booth.  We ask to move after ordering our drinks.  Took 20 minutes to get our drinks even after we told both waitresses and the hostess helped us move.  Pops and I both ordered the 16oz prime rib so we could have leftovers for lunch the next day.   They bring out our prime ribs and say our baked potatoes are on the way.  Pictures attached.  Almost half of it was fat.  I said oh my gosh that's a lot of fat.  Waitress says nothing.   \nPops and my hubby ordered salads and I ordered mushrooms as my other side.   They bring my daughters and husbands meals came.  A few minutes later we get out baked potatoes.   Hubby says where is my potato?   Well they had given him my mushrooms and he was well on his way of eating them.   So you would think I'd get new mushrooms right?  Nope.  Just slide the half eaten mushrooms to my plate.   Then we order another round of drinks and it takes 20 minutes to get a half chill fireball shot.    \nSo not a good experience.  If I'm paying $25 for a 16oz prime rib, I should get \"close\" to 16oz.  Not 8oz of meat and 8oz of fat.   \nAlso it's supposed to be unlimited bread.  How many loaves do you think we got?  Yup 1.  \nNot a happy experience.","date":"2017-01-27 22:16:46"}

The intercontinental suites are simply ok.  They're clean, they make your bed, bring you towels, etc.  But for the price, I have to give them only 2 stars.  \n\nOn the overpriced side, they're well over $100\/day for a std room, plus parking is $16 \/ day, plus wireless for $10 \/ day.  For that price in Cleveland, I expect at least something special.  That simply wasn't to be found at the Suites.\n\nI ordered room service.  Prices were on par with room service and delivery time was very fast, but my salad appeared as if it had been made a few hours ago and shrink wrapped.  They had a lame selection of beer on room service too.  They didn't even have single beers on their menu, they sold it by the six pack.  I managed to get a single bass which was palatable, but if you've read my other reviews, you know I like the local stuff better.  \n\nThe exercise room is pathetic, they converted a former guest room into an exercise room by removing the furniture and throwing in a bike, treadmill, and maybe an elliptical.  I don't remember for sure what was there. I took one look at it and walked out in disgust.  I went for a run instead, but you better know the area if you're going to do the same.  It's not too far from some places you definitely don't want to get lost in.  Head to the university and stay on campus.\n\nIf you're looking for a nice hotel in the area, I hear the other intercontinental is much better including an enormous workout facility.  If you find this place on the cheap and just need a place to crash, it's great for that.","date":"2008-10-04 17:40:27"}

Families are now asked to be shoved into their tiny beach club pool, so ridiculous and insulting for families.\n6.) DO NOT try to be in the lobby when the party pool closes at 7 pm...drunk people everywhere\n7.) The rooms are renovated,  but so ugly and they did a really bad job\n8.) Elevators are scary\n9.)

Well now we do! Haha, and unfortunately for my waistline it's uncomfortably close to my house, and just as good as it was in the states. Not much was lost in the cross-border translation. From the bright red and white self-congratulatory decor, to the awesome food and the giant bins of peanuts that fill the room and sate your appetite as you wait for your food: everything has come North. \nThe burgers are big (the standard burger is two patties) juicy and fresh. I like to keep the toppings simple (ketchup, mustard, mayo, lettuce, pickles), but there's pretty much anything you could want to put on them on the menu. The sesame seed bun does the job holding the messy burgers together and the processed cheese makes the burger creamy and adds just the right amount of flavour without taking away from the burger.\nThe fries are on par with the burger and as good as some chip truck fries:  big, fresh and crispy. And, as mentioned above, unless your incredibly hungry a regular fries can serve 2 easily and a large more. They actually measure out a heaping portion of fries and dump them in the bag loose to match the portion they give you in the container.\nIt's not cheap, you're looking at 25 dollars plus for two (share a fries and share a drink: there are free refills), but honestly it feels like you're easily getting your money's worth. No other burger chain comes close.","date":"2014-02-05 18:37:14"}

This place was a disappointment from beginning to end for us.\n\nFirst thing you need to know is that if you look at the menu, the only place the word prime shows up is in the title.  The steaks are not prime.  And they definitely do not taste like prime steaks.  They may have prime steaks on the menu, but unless it specifically says it is, it ain't.  \n\nSecondly, the service here sucks.  No sugar coating here.  I don't want people to make the same mistake I made and eat here when there is definitely much better in this town.  Go elsewhere for good service, or at least average service.\n\nWell, hopefully I've dissuaded you.  If not, or if you just like reading about poor dinners like watching a car accident, read on.  \n\nWe ordered the crabcakes.  And this is where the problems started.  We dutifully split it in half as usual, I began eating and noted it was good, then I bit into a crab shell.  Wow, that hasn't happened to me at any decent restaurant and I've had my share of crabcakes.  Disappointed but willing to overlook this, I bit into another piece of shell.  I'm paying a pretty decent sum for a crabcake that isn't remarkable in any way, and I'm biting into shells?  Unbelievable.\n\nNext up, the salads.  Except we didn't order salads.  They were for the table next to us.  With some horror I realized that our steaks and another table's salads were on the sam f-ing cart, but they served their salad first!  I don't think they do that kind of thing at a Black Angus, much less a restaurant that claims to be a top steakhouse.  Horrified but willing to ignore the two insults already suffered, we got our steaks and sides after a bit of a pause.  \n\nMy steak was ok.  18 oz bone-in ribeye.  The sauces weren't special but I'm not much of a sauce guy.  However, if you are going to pride yourself on your sauces, it should generate some interest from me.  Sides were decent.  Truffled mash potatoes were creamy, creamed spinach was what I expected.  I didn't much enjoy the bread though.  I got a pretzel roll that was extremely salty.  \n\nAnd then the final insult.  We finished our steaks, and waited a long time for our waiter to come back, but we didn't see him again.  The second cleaned up and brought us out the dessert menu, but that took quite some time.  At this point I hadn't seen our waiter in so long I assumed he actually left.  I thought that was incredibly rude to do that without turning the table over to someone.  Why are we ordering dessert still?  I wanted to give this place a chance to right the wrongs.  After ordering the crepe suzette (17 layers!), we waited a long time for our dessert.  A real long time.  And after finishing what I thought was a good dessert, we waited a long time for our check.  At this point our waiter returned!  We hadn't seen him since we ordered.  Apparently he had been taking care of another table.  He didn't tell us this, which would have alleviated a lot of the insult I felt by this time.  He cleared our dessert and we wanted no more of this restaurant.  It took a full 15 minutes for him to bring us our checks.  By this point we were angry.  We got here at about 6:45, and it was now 9:15.  So we spent an equal amount of time being seated, ordering and eating as we did waiting on our dessert and paying our check.  I won't be back here when there is so much better in town.","date":"2010-11-22 05:30:32"}

This location is pretty average in terms of speed and politeness, and the food seems to be cooked appropriately so what else do you want?\n\nHere's my PRO TIP: When you go to the place where the drinks are right after you order, get a fortune cookie, but slip it into your pocket, then at the end of the meal, go back and say outloud \"Oh man I am going to get a fortune cookie\" so they don't think you're taking two and then swipe a second one and eat it there.  They've got the most delicious fortune cookies and even though the messages are usually something stupid about sports like \"Oh you're gonna have a good sportsball game tomorrow\" you can still enjoy the cookie, and you've already swiped a second one to enjoy later so you're the real winner - sportsball or not.","date":"2014-02-23 22:01:54"}

I like the kind of tacos where they put the meat in the tortilla and then fry it to make the taco hard. At Tacos And More, the hard tacos are the ready made taco shells like what you would expect from Taco Bell. I guess doing it that way saves the cooks time.

Saved so much time that could have been wasted at the dealership if the numbers didn't come out right. And they got my interest rate at 3.24 when Avondale Nissan was trying to give me 7% which is higher than the rate of my first car when I had zero credit. My credit  is in the 700's so there is no way I should have been ripped off at 7% like Avondale Nissan tried. \n\nI was offered a trade in value of $9700 at the other dealership.

Even make a donation to their charity every time I shop there. Tonight's treatment by Chris and the cashier was unaccepptable. I was trying out different brands of dog kibble. Bought a high quality brand  a couple weeks ago. My dogs wouldn't eat it. Exchanged that for two different brands a week ago (Purina beyond and Hills diet). My dogs wouldn't go near the food. The Hills brand smelled awful. So I went to return the food. I walked in. Saw only one receipt was in the bag. I went to my vehicle to find the other one. When I came back, Chris is standing a few feet away from the register holding my receipt watching for me. I asked if there was a problem. His reply \"well yeah.\" He begins questioning me why I am returning the merchandise and mentions I seem to be continuously returning items. His question felt like he was interrogating me. I immediately took offense to his attitude and demeanor towards me. I said, my dogs wouldn't eat either one and one brand smells horrible. And proceeded to say I only returned one bag of food previously. Never returned any items prior to that. The prior cashier who helped me last time let me know food items can be returned if the dogs won't eat the food. Chris continued his line of questioning asking me what am I feeding the dogs now. Am I exchanging for another bag. I answered his questions and I shouldn't have had to. It's none of his business what I feed them now. And I do not want another bag. I'm upset. Frustrated by his actions and I rightfully tell him so. Telling him how I feel he is making me feel. I grabbed my receipt from him which he was holding onto tightly showing I am not liking his service. handed it back to the cashier and Chris continues to tell me, he is allowing the return. Absolutely right he is. Their no hassle free return policy was a huge hassle. I'm clearly unhappy and Chris continues to be a condescending on purpose by asking if there anything more he could do for me. I responded with after they way he treated me, I'm going to ask him for help. He continued his belligerent responces in which I told him to stop. How dare he treat me with such disrespect. As I'm walking out the store he continued to berate me with have a nice day. That is unprofessional. Awful customer service. Petsmart has lost my business for good.

Using the overused term \"hidden gem\" really doesn't do Alexander Michael's proper justice. This place is so tucked within Fourth Ward, you most likely wouldn't notice it even if you were to traipse the entire neighborhood. Which, in my opinion, really makes this place shine. There's no grandiose entry way or signage laid out in lights. Just an old house on the corner of 9th with low lighting and a cozy interior. \n\nHINT: If you've never been here, I'd recommend cutting all the way over to Graham St and then turning onto 9th. You can't turn down 9th from Tryon, as 9th is split into two sections and you won't be able to drive direct. Also, parking is sparse. Find a place around the neighborhood and walk a few blocks. There is plenty of residential 2hr parking on the streets. \n\nSat at the bar and loved every creek and crack of the old floors and pillars. It's kind of tight quarters, but it gives it a cool pub feel. The taps coming directly out of the old cabinet style system is just gorgeous. Tons of local brews and some other fine beer choices were available. Didn't indulge as it was a 1pm lunch. I ended up order the london broil sandwich. Goodness gracious I'm glad I did, too. It was just right for lunch and paired with the pasta salad, you can't go wrong. \n\nService is so friendly here.

Two days ago while we stayed at Caesars Palace, my friend insisted to have some to-go order of Chinese food within the hotel despite my objection. So, we went.\n\nWe ordered a BBQ Platter ($29.99), a Pork Ribs in Sweet Vinegar Sauce ($19.99), and one order of custard bun - Egg Yolk Quicksand as they called it ($6.99). In total, we paid over $60 for these three items. \n\nI was astonished to see the BBB Platter when we got back to the room and opened the box. This platter was about half the size of the same dish I ordered once there two years ago. In the combination platter, there were three kinds of meat - 4 very small pieces of Poached chicken, 4 very small pieces of Roast Duck and BBB Pork. I almost couldn't believe they were serving so few pieces of so tiny size at such quite high price. As to the BBB Pork, it was chopped (not slicked) into pieces about 5 times thicker than normal sliced BBQ Pork served at most other restaurants. Their poor and tacky knife cut made the BBQ Pork look as dull as a portion of pig's frozen dead body, totally unappetizing and iffy. I was wondering how they could charge $30 for a small box of food with quality level lower than that of a food court vendor. \n\nI must give a low rating to this restaurant again. I am a Chinese and I know how good Chinese food should look and should be prepared. They still don't think they should upgrade, instead they shrink the portion and size of the food and raise the prices with no business ethics at all. Doesn't Caesars Palace feel ashamed to allow such a low-end place sitting there to fool and rip off non-Chinese tourists and suckers?\n\nAfter this bad experience, I checked again their recent ratings on Yelp and found they've got more and more poor ratings. They deserve for what they are doing, and I believe if they continue doing so, they won't stay there too long.","date":"2017-08-16 04:15:55"}

Over an hour after our food was supposed to be ready, the guy, supposedly the owner, comes up and hands us the bill. It was very overpriced. He didn't apologize and didn't explain why it took almost TWO HOURS to make 4 people's take out Chinese food. \nThe food was also terrible quality. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the best, I'd give it a three at most. I had beef chop suey that had very little flavor, and my brothers both had chicken chow mein that had almost no noodles in them. \nThe staff was inconsiderate and there was no excuse for their tardiness, as there was maybe 5 other patrons in the restaurant. \nThere are many other good Chinese\/Asian restaurants in the area, and needless to say, I will not be coming here again.","date":"2010-11-22 02:57:41"}

One Sunday evening the security line was all the way to the other end of the airport, and guess what there were 3 TSA Pre agents and no one for the regular line??? What were they thinking...\n\nOnce you clear security check, the boarding area is clean and organized. Airline and restaurant staff are helpful and there are multiple flights leaving to all major hubs. \n\nThere is a Starbucks right after clearing security and the line moves quick. They are open early am (5:30am) so you can get your fix. \n\nWhen landing, I recommend using the departures\/ticketing level to exit as the arrivals level can get crowded pretty quick.","date":"2015-08-30 14:53:41"}

I'm either looking to gain 1000 lbs or am busy.  I'll take the busy option.  So since i was stuffed from an incredible waffle from Sugar Cafe I decided to get my fav salad of the moment, a beet salad.  It was a pretty big disappointment.  I'd say it was MAYBE 1\/3 a beat with TINY little cubes of beets, lettuce leaves and blue cheese.  Blue Cheese with beats?  No feta, really?!  Ok, I'm looking too much into this beet salad, but for realz, it was sorta lame.  \n\nOur server was OK, but sorta seemed like she wasn't into serving that day.  She kept forgetting to bring my friend her drink and she just seemed pretty lackadaisical.  No big thang I guess, I served and I was horrible!!  The outdoor patio was also really cute.  I was actually really into the whoel feel of the place, inside and out.  Very romantic in and very casual and comfy outside.  \n\nService was pretty slow too.  ALTHOUGH, what I will say in their defense is it looks like they only have two small grills in the front to make the crepes (which my two friends got) so I can see why it would take a while.  I did get a small bit of my friends crepe and it was awesome!  \n\nI will come back because I feel like I didn't get into the really good stuff on the menu....but I'm not sure what kind of service I'll receive and I definitely will go back expecting slow service at the very least.

We recently found about this particular location on Maryland and wanted to give it a try.\n\nThe manager, DJ, transferred from the Tropicana location.  He remembers our names (even though we only go a couple times a month these days) and is always welcoming and friendly.\n\nThis location is a bit different than most Wingstop locations.  There is a bar area.  There is more seating than normal.  The walls are lined with TVs showing sports.  I like all these things.  At the other Wingstop locations I would feel cramped and would want to leave soon after finishing my meal.\n\nThe wings I got on this trip were exceptionally large.  I've never had a problem with wing size at Wingstop and these were even bigger than usual.  I typically get the hot sauce which has a decent amount of kick.  The wings are never undercooked or overcooked and are quite tender and juicy.\n\nI love the ranch sauce.  It's thin without being watery.  Hard to explain, but it's perfect for going with the hot wings.\n\nThey have TWO of the coke machines with the touchscreens.  I love those touchscreens, but people can be slow figuring them out.

I received an order confirmation from Tasty Boom (as they are in charge of all the online orders).  After waiting for an hour and half I called the restaurant's direct line.  The person who picked up told me that a representative from Tasty Boom was supposed to call me because they had decided to cancel the order.  I never received any phone call, text, or e-mail stating that the order had been cancelled.  The Mr. Falafel employee also asked me, \"If I just placed a bunch of things in my order to make the minimum?\"  I then explained to him that I ordered what I wanted.  Also, I am not sure why \"what\" I decide to order is any of his concern as long as I meet the delivery requirements.  I expect that even if I was just ordering extra things I still would expect the food to be delivered.  I then called Tasty Boom and they told me that the restaurant had chosen to cancel the order because they felt like it wasn't \"worth it\" for them to deliver.  I would like to note that the website states a $20.00 minimum and my order was $25.00.  Also, the restaurant is located on Saint Jean's Boulevard and is a less than 10 minute drive from my location even with lots of traffic...what a joke and what a waste of time.","date":"2018-03-03 23:23:37"}

I had to contact Preferred CPAP Supplies and ask the status of my new machine. I was rudely told that I wasn't the only customer and the insurance paperwork took awhile. I reported that company to my doctor's office and was referred to Bennett Medical by them, and immediately cancelled my appointment and scheduled with Bennett. Bennett had my insurance approval and paperwork done in two days where the other local company wasted 3 weeks of my time and gave excuses. I had been with this other company for 4 years.

But then another service rep looked at her and mumbled something in French... She then said that our room does have a good view and then within the same sentence, said that really, there were not good views in this hotel.  Then, our toilet had very low water pressure so I called the front desk who said they would relocate us to another room. 15 minutes later, after frantically packing our things, a guy comes up to the room and says no other rooms are available and they would fix it in the a.m.   \"A\" for effort but \"C\" for the odd answers and possibly... lack of experience? \n\nRooms:  Loved the brick walls and hard wood floors INSIDE the rooms - a lot of personality with very high ceilings.

Not just send the product on it's way - my hubby picked it up - so not sure if he even looked at it before taking it.  I would have taken one look & refused it.

You could tell they were really trying to make an impression.  I returned there about 2 weeks ago for AYCE and the experience was quite different.  I went early, about 11:30 a.m. because I knew they are much busier.  There were only 4 other people in the restaurant.  I ordered my first round and as I waited, the restaurant filled up quickly.  I waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  When my first order of sushi arrived, it wasn't everything I ordered but I was glad it came because it took the edge off.  I slowly received more sushi.  The 3 orders of eel that I ordered never came.  I reminded the server.  She said she would check on it.  I waited some more.  I asked her for the 2nd time about the eel.  Even though the restaurant was practically full, she was the only server working, ping-ponging from table to table.  Since I had nothing to do I kept an eye on this poor guy at the bar who wasn't even acknowledged for at least 1\/2 an hour, not even to be given water.  He kept trying to get someone's attention!  Finally about 12:15, what I thought was another server arrived, turned out he was a bus boy and could only pick up plates and fill water.  FINALLY my eel arrived, it was super mushy, was much larger than the other sushi and didn't have that warm toasted crust.  You could tell it was thrown together.  Since I made such a big deal out of it, I ate it all even though I didn't like it.  I felt so sick after that, even though I didn't get my money's worth I didn't want any more (she wouldn't have been around to take another order anyway).  I was in the restaurant for well over an hour even though when I arrived I was one of 5 people there.  Then on the way out I noticed a dead roach on the floor, I nearly threw up.  The quality and service went way down with this place which is unfortunate.","date":"2015-07-16 06:55:28"}

It's not a sleazy, cheapo place. It's cozy and professional.\n\nLong version: My husband and I decided to make an impromptu trip to Las Vegas. We booked our hotel two days in advance and winged it while we were there. We knew, though, that we wanted to get a couples massage.\n\nOf course, we headed to Yelp, and read lots of good reviews for the hotel spas, but oh my gosh--$400 for a 50 minute massage? Ouch. No thanks. So, I Googled \"couples massage\" and came up with three non-day spa\/hotel places in Vegas. I called all three, checked reviews on all three, and then checked appointment availability and came up with Massage Pro. Booked an appointment sight unseen, and crossed my fingers.\n\nThe place is right off the strip--just head west on Sahara for a couple miles. It'd be too much to walk, I think, but it's close enough that taking a taxi shouldn't be too expensive. We had our car with us and it was a very quick drive.\n\nWhen my husband and I walked into the office, we were a little worried--the reception is super small and feels a little like a dentist's office. We filled out our paperwork, and were taken back to a much more spacious waiting room with dimmed lights, relaxing music, and a little fountain. From there, we were met by our massage therapists. We did have to wait a little longer than we expected, but it was only seven minutes beyond our appointment time, and they more than made up for it during the session. I think they spent an extra ten or fifteen minutes on us to make it up to us. :)\n\nWe ordered the 90-minute combination massage, which was a blend of Swedish and deep-tissue techniques. We paid just $90 each! Even with a $20 tip on top of each massage, we were still under the next least expensive massage we could find--and the experience was phenomenal!\n\nWe had a male therapist and a female therapist (we had confirmed this was all right when we called and made our appointments) who guided us to a designated Couples Room specially set aside for couples massages. The room was decorated, dimmed, and had soothing music playing. The beds were heated and we were asked if they were to our liking temperature-wise. They were perfect.\n\nDid I mention the therapists are nationally and locally licensed? Yeah. Cool.\n\nSo began ninety minutes of rubby, relaxing bliss. The therapists were receptive to our suggestions--a little softer on that spot, please; a little harder right there. The therapists were nothing but the utmost of professionals, watching our muscles for the relaxation of knots and responses to too much pressure. They adjusted their techniques to our preferences and my husband and I had a wonderfully relaxing afternoon. We had very enjoyable massages.\n\nWe didn't pack robes with us, and, not being a day spa, they don't provide them, so they were kind enough to let us use their shower usually reserved for customers getting body scrubs so we could rinse off some of the massage lotion. We got big, fluffy towels to dry off with and they even gave us an extra one, just in case.\n\nIn short:\nUNBEATABLE prices\nProfessional, personable, skilled, licensed, receptive therapists\nCouples massage room!\nNot a day spa--ambiance is definitely service-oriented, but still decorated and cozy\nAwesome massage\nNot sketchy (they have zero tolerance for inappropriate behavior)\n\nWhat are you waiting for?! Book your vacation massage for less than the price of most show tickets!","date":"2011-04-22 01:38:45"}

No thanks!\" I was recently in Las Vegas the week of Independence Day for a poker tournament and my back was hurting so much that I was having difficulty sitting at the tables for long periods of time. I got massages for three days in a row but got only a small amount of temporary relief. I thought about going to a chiropractor, but remembered how many times my friend had tried to get me to see her acupuncturist and decided I should give it at least one try. Boy, am I glad I did! \n\nThe needles are very, very fine and I only felt a small prick with a few (not even close to either a vaccination or finger stick)-- this was NOT a painful procedure. He inserted 16 of them from my neck to my ankles and then asked me to guess how many were there. I guessed 6-8. I seriously didn't even feel the others and none of them hurt. They then hooked some kind of electrodes to 6 of them (I was lying face down and couldn't see what he was doing) and sent weak electrical pulses through them. If you've ever had TINS treatments, the amount of current was far less (no muscle twitches) and felt as if someone was gently tapping my back in each spot. Then, they turned off the lights and played New Age type music while I relaxed. I don't know how long that lasted (maybe 15-20 minutes?) because I didn't have my watch on, but it was like taking a nap. After this time, they disconnected the electrodes and removed the needles. I felt very calm and a little groggy at this point. I had told him that I would be playing poker later that evening and he recommended that I take a nap when I returned to my hotel. I took his advice and when I awoke, I felt great! In fact, I was even able to walk from Caesar's to Bally's later to catch the free shuttle without any pain. Sure, that's not a great distance, but there is no way I could have done that prior to my acupuncture treatment. I got a second treatment the next day (my last full day in town) and when I left Las Vegas, I was pain free. Just today (about 10 days later) my lower back pain has been bothering me again (though not as severe), so tomorrow morning I will look up the local doctor whom my friend recommended. I hope he is as good as Dr. Lok! If you are in Las Vegas and have back pain, you really need to go to Dr. Lok.","date":"2012-07-16 04:33:37"}

These folks have less than no clue about what customer service is. My brother moved to Scottsdale from Minneapolis. He arrived well ahead of his PODS container. However, when the container did arrive no one bothered calling to let him know his unit had arrived. When he called them he was told, \"Oh yeah. The container arrived last week.\" It never occurred to anyone to let my bro know that his container had arrived.\nNext was the issue of trying to schedule delivery of the unit to his home. Problem is, no one at PODS location has any discernible grasp of how production scheduling works. All they were interested in telling him is that there will be extra fees for overtime because they're so busy. Since when are the internal logistics problems at PODS any concern of the client? Thankfully, my brother is a very persuasive bloke and he takes very little guff from incompetent lackeys. Of course he paid no additional fees, but a more timid individual would likely be held up for extra charges.\nAnd then there's the challenge of trying to contact PODS. All communication and billing are handled at a centralized call center, and it's a typical call center staffed by individuals who are paid far too little to give a crap about people calling in with questions, problems, and concerns. So, if you want to contact the local location to see if the unit has arrived...no dice! You get to deal with a call center lackey.\nMy brother did give a positive shout-out to the guys PODS sent out to empty out his home in Minneapolis and load the container. They damaged only two pieces of furniture and they didn't break near as many fragile items as he was expecting they would, so he was pretty pleased with that.\nBottom line here is that until PODS matures and figures out its logistics issues, timing issues, and customer service issues, you'll do much better with U-Haul or Atlas Van Lines.","date":"2015-11-18 19:10:00"}

If one show goes then all the hotels must have one like it. \nThe tribute shows are making the rounds ( Elvis, Neil Diamond, \"Ledgends\") and this tribute show to the Beatles is one of the very best in Vegas. \nA real  benefit of this show is that the ticket prices are $40 -50.00. A great value when compared to other shows with ticket prices spiraling up towards $175 -200.00\nThe show is presented in two parts, the first part is early Beatle tunes with the four dressed in the neru jackets. The second half is later beatles music with the Fab Four changing into Sgt. Pepper Lonely Hearts Club outfits. The final song is a solo rendition of John Lennons \"Imagine.\"\nGreat stuff, great music and a dynamic ending with \"Imagine. \"\nThis show gets you singing along with all the songs you know by heart - and it does not take much imagination for you to close your eyes and swear that the real Beatles are performing right in front of you. They play their own instruments ( unlike the Monkees ) and have the songs down pat. They even look the part. \nJust really good stuff. Well, well done.\n I just wish it were a little longer. The time just rockets by.\nTry it - you'll like it ....","date":"2007-12-08 22:09:07"}

I cannot tell you how much I love this winery. It's right in the heart of Pittsburgh! WAIT, better yet... right in the Strip District! Our very own urban winery!\n\nYou must go visit their digs, I promise, you won't be sorry when you're sipping a delicious red or white! This space is really beyond words. As soon as you walk in you feel like you've traveled to some far away castle in a romantic foreign city. It's dimly lit, with beautiful dark wood and a fully stocked bar waiting for you to imbibe. \n\nThey have six wines right now, but the grapes are crushed fresh in house (or at least in the presence of the winemaker, Tim), so you know they're not rushing to produce a mass amount of products, just a handful of marvelous blends! My fave of the moment is the Malbec. I've been really into it for a while now and really love their blend. I honestly have had some pretty bad ones, and this is true to form. I also think this is such a white wine type of area, I'm glad to see a place putting effort into promoting the reds.\n\nBut here's the other cool thing. They have a downstairs area that matches the same cool vibe of the upstairs. It's thee perfect place for an unique event. It apparently fits around 100 and would be the perfect pick for a small reception or a hip party. I wouldn't care what kind of event it was, I'd want to crash it here! \n\nThey also offer custom labeling, so if you ever need a unique gift this is the way to go! This is seriously the way to go for a nice night out. Just go for the winerific experience and leave with a happy buzz!","date":"2012-12-04 03:01:04"}

Unfortunately, \"The Buffet\" as it's now known has declined quite a bit in quality.\n\nFirst, all of the meats are pre-sliced which is crazy. The slices of prime rib were totally dried out and starting to turn grey. The turkey fared a little better, but gravy rescues pretty much everything although either the turkey or gravy was very salty. Speaking of salty, I was curious to try the pho which was, you guessed it, super salty. There is no salad bar here and instead you can get various salads made that looked really good - too bad no one was manning the counter. And finally, the most ridiculous thing of all was the pre-scooped ice cream in dishes which had melted into a soup. On the plus side, the crab legs weren't bad and I enjoyed the mini donuts and chocolate covered strawberries.\n\nI hope this buffet gets their act together soon.

Let me start by clarifying an inaccurate statement, Blue Martini does not take reservations on Sunday night. They actually are attempting to change a Bar Restaurant into a Night Club on Sunday nights. \nNeo-Soul, a promotion company operating on Sunday's has increased their visceral attitude toward anyone not willing to pay 300 dollars for a  bottle service on Sundays.  On Sunday August 7, 2016, I visited the Blue Martini as I always do several times a month.   During my visits I normally spend  around 100 dollars.  After checking online banking I discovered that I have spent approximately 500 dollars since mid May.\nYesterday I ordered chicken wings and a cocktail around 730pm.  I waited 45 minutes for my wings.  I look forward to eating BM wings on Sunday since it is the only day that I eat Chicken.   Half way through my chicken wings a Neo soul representative came over to where I was sitting with a retired engineer.and a VA Nurse.\nThe unknown Neo soul promoter described as early 30's, black male, bald head and bow tie, failed to introduce himself.  The first thing out of his mouth was \"Other women are wondering why you have a stool to eat your dinner with. He further stated, I have to ask you if either of you two are disabled\" (he clearly was the one to ask about disabilities).. I was embarrassed that he would stand by with a security officer while I ruffled through my purse in the dark for 3 minutes. I assumed he would be allowing me a reasonable accommodation after forcing me to reveal my disability and showing my credentials.  Instead he was throwing me out of my stool and escorting me way in the back where they hid chairs for Profit.  The promoters actions were consistent with some one without knowledge of Restaurant Regulations.  \" if a patron orders food from a bar that patron should be afforded a proper bar stool\".  Meaning,If a patron orders food from a Blue Martini Bartender at a bar and pays for the meal a bar stool,and proper eating utensils  MUST be provided. Blue Martini can't profit from a customer and then not provide a stool in order for Neo Soul to increase it profits.  The Neo Soul rep. appeared surprised when I produced my Armed forces Veterans disability ID as if he was not expecting that. I explained to him I was a Desert Storm Veteran and retired from the armed forces and Las Vegas Metro.  He then told me to grab my half eaten chicken wings in order to place me out of the way in the back.  I was not going to pay several hundred dollars for a bottle service and chicken wings to hear the same band so that I could sit down for ten minutes to eat.  I asked him if there was an emergency and why I could not eat my last two chicken wings.   I explained that it would not be unreasonable to allow a disabled veteran to finish two wings and then move.  He said \"Let's take the disabled veteran out of it\".  I asked why when he was the one that interjected the disability as a prerequisite to a bar stool which is inconsistent with restaurant  practices. It is also unsanitary to drag your food around in the dark .  The Neo Soul rep also felt it necessary to have a Blue Martini Security officer stand by as a \"Show of Force.\" We took this as excessive, embarrassing and humiliating because it was for profit.  Neo Soul felt  it necessary to interrupt my dinner  so that Neo could increase profits.  Neo Soul is confusing Blue Martini with nightclub practices. Neo Soul and Blue Martini's failure to fallow guidelines of restaurant\/Bar have generated a multitude of complaints.  Lastly, He continued to make the situation worse by making me stand and eat my remaining two wings.  \n\nNeo Soul claim that by removing seats people are able to get to the bar to order drinks easier are \nfalse. The first bar where more then 25-35 bar stools remain, individuals are allowed to eat and drink around the bar with a proper bar stool. \n\nSecondly, at 815 pm there appeared to be about 5 people at the bar on this particular night.  \nLastly,the stool that was taken from me was moved to a small high table where 3 dancers immediately occupied the table.  \n\nThe entire scene was mishandled and escalated by the Neo Soul rep.  The rep who hides dozens of chairs from restaurant goers was unnecessary and purely for profit.  I would like to reiterate the fact that,  You absolutely cannot make reservations. This entire \"rigged system\"  is sit up to increase the profits of the unprofessional Neo Soul reps desperate to make more money. \n\nI asked  to speak with a Manager at this point.  This manager can only be described as stocky, Latino with a neatly trimmed beard.  He was extremely professional and apologized for the behavior of the Neo Soul representative's behavior.  He further stated that Neo Soul Rep was unprofessional and to contact Scotty M immediately.\nAdditionally, he offered to purchase my chicken wings and I said \"thank you but If you could give us some drink tickets instead.","date":"2016-08-13 01:29:59"}

It used to be unlimited, along with all the thinly sliced beef, pork, and sliced chicken, seafood (including crab legs and shrimp), veggies that you can DIY cook in the hot pot at your table.  But for what you are getting and what they are charging, it is still a good value proposition. Come on, for $20 a person without the hassle of getting all the ingredients yourself and the cleaning up afterwards, totally worth it! \n\nI first came to Shabu Grill all the way to this section of LV because of an UYE hosted by Debbie N.  The event was a resounding success, and we pretty much got to try as much of their menu as we were able to stuff down our faces.\n\nSo when a guys night out event was recently organized at this very same location, it was a no brainer for me.  The food is still very good, the service was just as attentive, and the experience just as positive.  The restaurant even accommodated us with extra portable hot pot setups, so 2 instead of 4 or 5 people shared each hot pot.  It just worked out better for us.\n\nThe main reason I like this place is the fact that everything for the shabu shabu portion of the dining experience is DIY, including getting the ingredients from the refrigerated cooler nearby.  I love the fact that I can get as little or as much of something, instead of being forced to finished big plates of one item before I can order more or something else.  \n\nThe DIY sauce and condiments bar is pretty cool.  Not as extensive as comparable restaurants in SoCal, but you get to customize your dipping sauces as wonderfully or not so fantastically as your creativity and inner toque wearing chef would allow.  But it is pretty hard to score a TOTAL FAIL in this minor endeavor, so relax and just have a go at it.  The important thing is to have fun and enjoy this interactive meal solo, but preferably with a small group of friends.\n\nI would totally go back, especially when the weather is still very nippy in the evening.\n\nNote:  There is a \"bar\" in the front when you walk in, but they do NOT serve alcohol at this establishment.  But if you have room for some beer or other adult beverages, there is a PT in the same strip mall.\n\n\n\nReview #2 of 2014","date":"2014-01-17 04:05:45"}

I \"Yelped\" banh mi sandwiches for Phoenix last night because I was craving one and wanted to find out what Yelpers out there think are the best.  I was a bit surprised to see Reathrey on the list as they are not a Vietnamese restaurant, but having patronized the restaurant at least a half dozen times, I decided to read through the reviews.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I originally went to the restaurant after reading the glowing article in Phoenix Magazine.  Our first visit there was pretty uneventful.  We ordered the Mi Keaw soup, spring rolls and the crepe (which by the way was served slightly burned with that side facing down- but I never complain about my food and ordered it again on later visits).  My only real complaint that first evening was the incredibly uncomfortable bench seating.  On subsequent visits we opted for the tables in the center of the space.  I have tried a number of different things on the menu and while having no other Cambodian food to compare it to I find it to be just meahhh.  My boyfriend on the other hand loves the Mi Keaw soup and has ordered it as take out a number of times and is the reason for our repeat business.  In my opinion the Pho at many valley Vietnamese restaurants is much tastier.\n\nOkay - back to the reason for the one star review.  So here I was reading through the reviews when I started coming across the owner's incredibly RUDE, SARCASTIC, CONDESCENDING, DISRESPECTFUL and downright UNACCEPTABLE responses to his less than stellar reviews.  I have three words for you GET OVER YOURSELF!!! I don't care if you are running a Michelan star rated restaurant (which CLEARLY you are not) that type of disgusting behavior will run your business into the ground.  I, for one, will be spreading the word and NOT in a good way.  \n\nSincerely,\nA very disappointed EX-patron","date":"2013-05-07 20:01:31"}

I needed one very badly, having been using a relative's vehicle for several months, but that they now needed back. I had planned ahead and done my research, and wanted a Ford CMax Hybrid. My work offered a discount\/cash-back deal through Cars.com, so I submitted the request and my info was sent to Berge. My plan was to take advantage of the 4th of July weekend specials.\n\nI was almost immediately sent an email from a salesman named Chris. He wanted to know what I was looking for in a vehicle. I replied right away with the details... But the only email address given was a generic one, nothing direct. There was no response. A few days later, he sent me another email, this time with a map to the dealership, but with no indication my reply was received. I replied back, asking for some quotes, but again got no response. I was anxious with the impending July 4th weekend, but held hope I could still make contact. I decided to call. \n\nUnfortunately, the only number he gave me was his personal cell. That Friday after work, I called and was immediately sent to voicemail. I got a text saying he was at dinner, but would return my call. I left a voicemail explaining that I badly needed a car, either from him or someone else at the dealership, and that he hasn't actually replied to my emails (maybe he forgot to check the general inbox?) and I asked him to call me  back ASAP. I really needed the July 4th specials. \n\nThe weekend came and went, no reply from Chris. Frustrated, I went to a different dealership in Scottsdale and worked with wonderful people, and that next weekend negotiated a deal on a beautiful CMax that made up for missing out on both the holiday weekend deals and the cash-back deal through my work. TWO WEEKS LATER Chris emails me to say their servers were out of commission, which is why he didn't get my emails, and he would love to help me into a car (this all being said in poor spelling and no caps or punctuation ).\n\nMy brother was a car salesman for awhile, so I have a pretty good idea how it goes. I was only given his personal cell number so he could make sure he got my sale instead of anyone else. I'm also an IT student, so I have a very hard time believing their servers were down for two whole weeks. Either they have the worst tech support in the history of ever, or I was put off so I wouldn't have to be offered a holiday deal. Plus, what, did you not check your voicemail?? \n\nMy experience here was beyond unprofessional. I'm glad, now, that I went where I did for my car. Berge only saw my business as a number. I will never shop with them.","date":"2015-01-03 21:02:26"}

Rex Marvin is that person. Rex Marvin's search for the greatest food and the most huffable gasoline makes him the tragic figure that in literature would get the girl, save the day, and have the most severed heads in jars in his basement (if it was a Disney book).  The good news people, is that all of those things in real life are true.  If you consider a graveside ditch near the freeway to be a \"basement\".  Rex does. Recently, Rex was accosted for no reason.  Rex and his woman, Three Legged Midget Maggie, were minding our own business.  Rex was casually tossing TLMM up in the air until she was able to grab onto a ledge and let herself in.  Rex tossed her and she didn't come down. A sure sign that TLMM has accomplished her mission. Rex turns around to have 4 metro cops staring at him. They were big. They were not smiling.  Rex decided to break the ice.  Rex asked \"How many buy one get one free garden hose or industrial blacktop sealant coupons does it take to get 4 cops to walk away and pretend like they saw nothing?\" The next thing Rex knew he saw flashes of light. Rex smiled. Darkness. Rex woke up on the floor of a squad car while the cops talked about the loser they beat and were taking into custody. It must have been someone else.\n\nRex's left eye was shut but he saw that they had stopped at a gas station. They talked about food. They were getting gas station pasta. The smaller one looked back to check on Rex, and said that he was in the mood for \"frozen noodles in sauce\". Rex closed his eyes and tried not to vomit at the idea. He felt with his food that the back door wasn't closed all the way. Rex dislocated his wrists, slipped off the cuffs, and pushed the door open...and much like the time Rex woke up in Candice Bergen's bedroom...he was out before something that could never been taken back happened.  Not going to jail...no Rex can do hard time...but smelling heated frozen pasta is something that Rex will not endure.  Rex has endured more than most. Remember, Rex lived in drag as Jodi Foster's lesbian lover for 3 years...Rex HAS ENDURED! Still everyone has a line not to cross. One of Rex's is frozen pasta...the other is participating in the underground black market 8 track tape racket...lucrative, but Rex only needs to lose 3 toes to know that some money just isn't worth it. Rex has brains.\n\nRex needed to cleanse himself from the memory of that awful experience...so Rex ran. He crawled. He climbed into someone's trunk. He eventually reached the closest place he could find...Manhattan Pizza.  It is in a strip mall behind a bank and near a place that sells fancy popcorn, and none of that bodes well...but ignore the warning signs and go in.\n\nThere are a few staples in an Italian restaurant, and one of them is the Chicken Parm. If you can't make a lights out Chicken Parm then you should close your doors. Manhattan makes a very good one. The chicken is tender, the batter is crispy, the mozzarella is good and the sauce is great. Their red sauce is excellent. Just the right amount of garlic and acidity. The pasta is always cooked well, never over cooked and mushy. The next is meatballs. Manhattan makes a very good meatball; it is almost all meat and no unnecessary fillers. Lastly, can it make a pizza...a great pizza...and Manhattan...excels! Rex is more the New York style pizza kind of man. If you like a doughy crust, you are a hick, and this place might not be for you. They do put a lot of toppings on it, and that is a good thing. \nThe truth about Manhattan is the same truth people say about Rex Marvin...almost everything is good.  There isn't too much Rex hasn't tried he didn't like. The fried foods are all good, with a nod to the mozzarella sticks.  The pastas are all good and have good sauces.  The Alfredo could have some more parmesan cheese in it for Rex's taste, but you shake some more on and it is good.  \n\nThe prices are too high. Period. The food is good, but Rex finds himself not going because for the same amount of money there are better options. If they dropped the prices Rex would eat there a lot more.\n\nThere are a lot worse places to go than Manhattan especially for the pizza. They do a very good job at New York style pizza, not perfect but a very good job.  They obviously care and try hard to make a quality product.  Sometimes they succeed better than others, but it is never awful. Rex can appreciate that. Just like Three Legged Midget Maggie, sometimes it takes a few throws, but she always tries. She always gives an effort...and in the end of the day...that means something.  Rex doesn't know what it means, but it means something.\n\nMahattan isn't Rex's first choice. It isn't even his second or third, but in a pinch it is good. It is really a 2 1\/2 star place. Order right, catch it on the right night, it can be very good. Normally it is just above good. For the money, you can do better than good.","date":"2012-03-01 00:26:47"}

They all loved most of the choices of the rolls they got, the only exception was the appetizer that was ordered. For the price, it was NOT worth it! Was maybe 4 bites worth of food.

She said they have a strict no one under 21 policy at all hours. I read a review from January that mentioned  kids, and they don't say that on their website, but ok. I explained the situation, and asked her if I might just visit the table to drop off the card and let my friend know that I couldn't stay. She said no. No offer to take the card in for me, no offer to let my friends know that I was outside and not allowed in, just simply no. And so, that will be my last visit there.\n\nUpdate: the GM reached out to my friend who booked the party, and then mailed me a personal letter of apology and a gift card.

The previous year I went, there were a lot fewer customers. However, despite being full, the cafe was quiet as people worked away or kept their nose behind the newspaper. And no more bugs on the windowsill! Yayy!\n\nTo get in touch with its Latin American roots, El Cafecito offers dancing lessons after the cafe closes down and changes the place into a dance floor. They have tango every Wednesday and salsa every Thursday between 7 PM to 10\/11 PM. So if you are looking for something new to try, why not with some fun dance lessons to bring out your inner dancing queen\/king? With some coffee on the side of course.\n\nOverall, I think this is a sweet place for people who would like to study or work in peace but still be surrounded by people (does that make sense?).

Let me start from the beginning. I was invited to a wedding for November 26. I planned my whole trip from Denver, Colorado the whole month. I bought an expensive dress and made sure I had everything I needed for that special day. On November 25th I don't know what the heck happened but my neck Popped! \n\nYeah my next popped and I could not move my neck! I swear I cried all day because I was in pain. I stayed home thinking by the next day I would feel better. Nope. I was worse. So I looked up for a chiropractor. Keep in mind I also don't have health insurance because that is expensive as hell. \n\nI find this place and it has 5 stars. I call and this amazing nice lady answered the phone. I forgot her name unfortunately but she was so sweet. She told me to go in and the doctor would see me. \n\nI go in and immediately they start working on me. I apparently tore a muscle and that is why I was in pain and could not move my head! I was scared and I talked to Dr. Brandon Wentzel about the wedding I was going to be attending at 6 that day. He promised to make me better and that I would be able to move. \n\nGuess what? He did! I left the doctor place able to move and even though I still had pain it lowered from a 10 to 1! \n\nSO happy to have been able to go here and have two people take care of me and make me better. Thank you so much. \n\nPlus it was not pricey and did not cost me an arm and a leg!\n\nThank you so much!","date":"2016-12-04 02:17:49"}

I visited on a Saturday and the Casino was very busy.  There was a line for the Buffet and it took about 20 minutes to get in.  I was seated and noticed that the chair was comfortable, something I hadn't noticed before.  I tried samples of various food.  The Chicken was cooked properly and had a good flavor.  The Mexican Rice was really good as was the taco meat, seasoned well and was tasty.  The BBQ sausage was good, and so were the BBQ Chicken Wings.  The BBQ Ribs were tender and tasty.  I had Apple Cobbler and Carrot Cake with frozen Vanilla Yogurt (Ice Cream?) on top.  The quality of everything I ate was better than what is served at other Station Casinos.  The service was good and my drink was filled as needed and dirty plates were removed in a timely manner.  The wait staff was busy but were friendly and asked me if I needed anything several times.

This is my favourite  new restaurant of 2017. Aloette is the casual sister to Alo, upstairs. The room is long and narrow, and feels like a cross between a classic diner and an upscale train dining car. Waiters bustle around the tight space creating a fun, busy atmosphere.\n\nWe sat at the bar. No reservations are taken but we walked right in at 6:00.\n\nWe started with beef tartare and fried smelts. The tartare was good and went well with the fresh horseradish included. Smelts were crispy and lightly battered. A nice surprise were the fried jalapenos that went surprisingly well with the fish. The real star though was the free cheesy toast and butter.\n\nThe mains were absolutely delicious. The cornish hen was cooked perfectly crispy and was an umami explosion with mushrooms and spinach, but could have used a tiny bit more salt and\/or sauce. The burger with fried cheese on top was fantastic. Now that the Harbord Room is closed I think this is now my favourite restaurant burger in Toronto.\n\nFor dessert we had the apple pie sundae and a cup of strong coffee.\n\nService was impeccable. My wife was given samples of two wines to compare when she couldn't decide, a touch that I always appreciate. The wine list could be a bit more extensive but this is a quibble. A fantastic new spot.

Trivia night really brings out the local characters and can get competitive. The first ones to the bar on gamedays get first pick of what games go the bigscreens in the bar, kinda cool. My only complaint is the location- I wish it were stand-alone and not in a stripmall. Try the fried pickles!","date":"2012-11-06 04:04:20"}

I always get a custom salad, and they have pretty good choices for regular and premium add-ons. I usually get the spinach with black beans, red onion, red pepper, and mushrooms. I add avocado, and just get their house vinaigrette. It's nothing special, but the ingredients have always been (and tasted) fresh and crisp. They also give a very generous portion of avocado, which I really enjoy. It's nice to have this option around campus.

My boyfriend went to U of I and we somehow stumbled upon this hidden gem. Well, I suppose it's not so hidden since there is usually a long wait. But don't be discouraged! The wait is well worth it, I promise. \n\nTry to make your way through the door, find the guy in charge, and put your name on the list. There's not much space in this place. I guess that would be my one complaint. It can get pretty crunched, especially if you're waiting. However, what is better to tide you over than a delicious beer? Now, let's talk about this beer.\n\nThey have new selections on tap all the time. Please, do your beer pallet a favor and don't order the usual domestics and imports (Miller, Bud, Heiniken, Corona, etc). Those are just fine for any regular restaurant. Why miss the glorious opportunity to try something mind-blowingly good? Seriously, these beers are amazing. They come from different breweries across the country. Places\/companies you've never heard of. Combinations of flavors you would never think to try. I once had an oyster beer here. Sounds disgusting but it was so good. Trust me on that. I'm very picky and I liked it. You can also get a flight of 7 beers on a dogbone shaped tray (how fitting!). This flight has all the beers that are on tap in 4 oz glasses. You can share them with a friend and then order the one you like best!\n\nNow, on to the food. So SO good. There are a few different sauce choices you can get. Not being one for spicy, I get the Georgia Peach. It is soo good on anything you get. There is no bad item on this menu. The pulled pork is amazing as are the hamburgers. Hard to believe a hamburger could be so good, but it is. The brisket is also amazing. They cook it for 12 hours. How could it not be? Try to get here relatively early though, because some items like the brisket run out later in the evening. While it's a bummer, think of it as a good thing. This way, you know they're not just heating it in the microwave. They cook it, and once it's gone, it's gone. Oh and the fries are amazing, whether you get the regular or sweet potato.\n\nI know this was a long review, but I really can't say enough about this place. I'm obsessed. It's a bummer that my bf graduated so we can't go all the time since we live near Chicago. However, I will make any excuse to go down. Going there this weekend for Halloween. Can't wait to visit my favorite BBQ place in all the land!","date":"2011-10-27 15:48:15"}

I didn't have insurance for glasses then he gave me a very reasonable price.  He is very friendly and chatty, and despite our age difference (I am probably not much older than his children) we became quick and great friends.  I even go over just to chat after I got my glasses.\nNow years later, he is still a good friend, and everytime I go in he always ask about my grandma.  It is hard to find good service nowadays, and he kept it up all these years.  His business had grown (and I have to admit I had send some friends there also) and you might need to wait a bit longer for his \"personal\" service, but the other workers are very nice and helpful too.

The Gyro was indeed huge and the meat was flavorful but the veggies were close to the end of their shelf life. The fries that came with the meal were crap actually, I know that they are fresh cuts fries so lets make sure that they are cooked all the way through and have some sort of uniformity in size and the oil that they were fried in was obviously fairly old. The fries were on a greasiness level of their own. I have never had such soggy fries. \n\nThe service was certainly some of the most friendly I have had in sometime and the proce for the Gyro combo really is hard to beat it came in right around $6.

After moving to Ahwatukee from Central Phoenix a couple of years ago, this location became the closest to me. It used to be reliable and consistent but the last several times I've been, the quality has really suffered. \n\nA few months ago I ordered some take-out for my family.  After getting it home and going to eat my meal, I realized that my order was very wrong.  Now I'd become accustomed to this location forgetting things like sauces for the appetizers, napkins, soy sauce and fortune cookies (things that are supposed to be included with take-out), but my dish was inedible to me.  \n\nI called to complain, the manager was apologetic and offered that I come back and pick up a replacement OR he would send me a gift card to replace my meal.  Since I have an infant that I needed to get to bed, I opted for the gift card.\n\nA month or so went by and my husband suggested Pei Wei.  That's when I realized that I never received the replacement gift card!  We ordered and when my husband picked it up, he mentioned the issue we had the last time and they gave him a discount.  As usual, things were missing from the order (no appetizer sauce, napkins, fortune cookies, etc.) and the food was just okay.\n\nTonight we ordered again, this time the food was just horrible.  Bland, no taste whatsoever for either of our dishes!  I ordered the new Korean BBQ with chicken (I had it before) and really liked it.  My husband had the same but with tofu and vegetables.  Neither of us thought the food was good at all.  The sauce which is normally very tasty was so bland and watery that it literally ran off of the chicken.  The 'salad' that comes with it was wilted and soggy, clearly not fresh.  And as expected, no sauce for the crab wontons, no napkins, no soy sauce & no fortune cookies.  \n\nI don't think we will be going back anytime soon - at least not to this location - they really need to get it together.  We're tired of the issues every time we eat in or get take-out from here.","date":"2011-03-20 02:04:11"}

Stick with the bags and corn and you'll be OK. \n\nThere's really nothing special about the place that would recommend it over other similarly-themed sports bars in the area, and the manager could use a visit from Jake Tapper at Bar Rescue. No effort is made to make the outside patio tolerable during the summer so nobody eats there. What a waste. The restaurant itself is located way in the back corner of a strip mall where the confined location guarantees it will be like an oven.","date":"2016-03-30 22:28:36"}

The diverse French cuisine will appeal to Francophiles, and the comprehensive wine selection will appeal will oenophiles.\n\nThe French have always done brunch well (partially due to their social belief that drinking after 12 pm is acceptable, even admirable).  Marche Bacchus is my favorite place to go in Vegas for a brunch that makes me forget I live in the Mojave dessert.  Also, the restaurant offers both their brunch and lunch menu at this time, which offer many more authentic choices than just their dinner menu.\n\nIf it's spring in Vegas, I order the Moules Frites, mussels in white wine butter sauce with crusty baguette, a light and delicious classic that Marche does well; don't forget the Mimosa.  \n\nIf it's summer, I order the lobster avocado croissant, pair it with a Riesling from the market; the sweetness of the Riesling highlights the lobster and brings out the richness of the avocado.  \n\nIf it's fall, I order the duck confit & fettucini pasta, it's a calorie splurge but completely worth it.  \n\nAnd if it's winter, I get the Les Oeufs En Meurette, three perfect poached eggs in hearty red wine sauce with ham and mushrooms; it's a dish that warms your stomach, and your heart; break some rules and order a glass of Cotes Du Rhone with it: red wine works for daytime when it's Vegas harsh dry winter.\n\nDessert is their weakness.

The other reviews didn't hurt either, so I made the effort to go there.\n\nI cannot begin to say how bad it was.   I ordered an egg salad sandwich on a bagel and coffee. A simple enough order, or so I thought.  How bad could it be, you're thinking?    Let me tell you:  undercooked eggs with bright yellow, hard jelly-like yolks, chopped in HUGE chunks with an enormous amount of tasteless, gooey mayonnaise on a Montreal sesame seed bagel (the bagel was good).  \n\nSalt, pepper or any kind of seasoning never saw that 'egg salad'.  It was served with potato chips and a side order of POTATO SALAD??  and a pickle.   Talk about a starch redundancy!   The coffee was tepid at best, and the milk I poured into it had some suspicious looking 'flakes' on the coffee that made me think it's last good day was yesterday.   \n\nThe presentation was attractive, but what good is that when the food was almost inedible??   I spent almost $9 for food that I could not stomach.\n\nThere is a sign on the wall announcing a change in management, which I could possibly have forgiven their lack of knowledge of menu prep if the changeover date wasn't listed as 2010!!\n\nThe people serving me were Japanese, and I suspect they don't know anything about Jewish deli at all.

At first, I was really turned off by the \"tex-mex\" concept and even the name \"Mesa Grill\" didn't sound too appetizing, but we took a risk... and Bobby delivered.  We came here for my husband's 27th birthday and he had a wonderful time.\n\nSERVICE: \n5 Solid Stars!  The hostesses sat our party right away even though not everyone was there.  We were immediately served water and asked if we wanted any cocktails.  I really loved our waiter.  He wasn't just polite and attentive, but he was also engaging us in wonderful conversation throughout our meal.  He talked to us about how long he had been working there, and what Bobby's like... and he knew the menu like the back of his hand.  It was like having a new friend dine with us throughout the duration of our meal.  I wish I caught his name so I can give him props!\n\nFOOD:\nBread Basket - 2 stars.  They start you off with a variety of breads.  There was a jalapeno one, another one with some blue corn in it, and a third one that I can't recall.  All were very unique, but unfortunately, I wasn't a fan.  I didn't think the bread was very soft or moist, and the flavors didn't do it for me.  Kudos for thinking outside the box though.  The butter also wasn't the soft, spreadable kind.\n\nBlue Corn Pancake - 5 stars.  This appetizer came highly recommended by our server.  There was barbecued duck inside pancake (like a glorified taco), and a habanero chili star-anise sauce drizzled all over it.  The flavors all worked so well together to deliver an explosion of flavors in my mouth.\n\nSpanish Chorizo Quesadilla - 4 stars.  This was larger than expected!  It is pretty filling and could easily be substituted for a meal as a filler.  Or you can split this between 2-3 people and share it as an appetizer.  It's a pretty heavy dish and hard to eat too much of.  There's a large fried egg on top of a tortilla.  Embedded in the tortilla is smoked tomato salsa, grilled green onion, and crispy artichokes.  \n\nFor our entree, my husband and I shared the New Mexican Spice-Rubbed Pork Tenderloin even though I was realllly eyeing the 22 ounce bone-in Ribeye.  The waiter said the pork tenderloin was their signature dish so that's why we ordered it even though I'm not a huge fan of pork.  It wasn't until the dish arrived that we were convinced we had made the right choice!!  WOW, that was one tender, delicious, savory, melt-in-your-mouth piece of meat.  The spice rub added a bit of heat, and I can easily say this is the best piece of pork I've ever been served.  It came with a side of the most amazing tamale.  I can't even begin to describe how good it was.  You just have to try it.  5 Stars for this entire dish!!!\n\nI sampled some of the other dishes from my friends, but the pork dish was the definite standout.  My friend ordered the lamb chops, but they tasted a bit gamey and weren't as tender as they could've been.  The pan seared Halibut was tender and flaky paired with a lovely curry spice reduction.  I'd give both these dishes 4 stars.  \n\nAll in all a wonderful experience.  Glad I finally got to try one of Bobby's restaurants!","date":"2010-07-07 19:41:57"}

Now the tenderloin was tender, but like my friend's lamb, there was no tasting of anything but chilis. \n\n  Without like an aioli or some kind of dill yogurt to give your mouth a rest, it all just blends into generic spice tastes.    Adding in the heavyness of the dishes such as the recommended goat cheese queso fundido (Which was very delicious, but served with generic and easily breaking nachos)  you are left queazy and overfilled.\n\n20 minutes after our meal, on which the salad was comped and we were given free creme brulees (chocolate toffee, so rich and creamy), I began to feel very ill.   I ended up doubled-over in a forums restroom, the final and worst part of it all.\n\nI think of it as a science experiment, and sometimes science produces great things.  Sometimes you irradiate yourself.  This was more of the latter.   A lot of nice little things, such as the help and appetizers, but outweighed by a couple unforgivable offenses.   I also don't like a meal so poorly spiced that it causes my body to actually reject it.  \n\nSorry Bobby, maybe you should return and retune.","date":"2010-08-20 22:26:25"}

I enjoyed my appointments with Dr. Strain and found her to be knowledgable and attentive. However, I was incredibly displeased with how I was treated by the staff. I went through my vision insurance with a staff member and assumed this information was added to my file. I called a month or so later to order contacts and was told I could not pay for the contacts when I came and picked them up; I needed to pay for them over the phone. I have never paid for contacts before picking them up before but I figured it wasn't a big deal, just differences between offices. Once I got the statement for my order, I realized that they had charged me the full amount and not run anything through my insurance company. I called back and was met with no answers, saying they would call me back later. They never did, so I called back again and finally learned that my vision insurance had never been added to my file. After going through my information a second time, they then assured me they would file a claim with my insurance company and I would receive a check soon. Never once in this back and forth did anyone from the staff apologize or recognize that they had made a mistake. In fact, everyone I talked to seemed more agitated that they now had to reprocess the claim. A month later, I received my refund along with an updated billing statement. Amongst the revised patient\/insurance payment was a statement describing why the revision was necessary. It read: \"patient originally did not say to use insurance and paid in full for contacts-decided a few days later she would like us to bill vsp and refund her the remaining balance\". This is the first medical establishment I have come in contact with that required me to advise them of my desire to use my medical insurance. Professional medical establishments run benefit checks and inform the customer of their costs prior to performing the service.

Once you've picked your ice cream flavour and your mixins, they mash everything up right in front of you on a frozen counter. Then once it's all perfectly mixed, they scoop it into a cone (or a cup of you prefer) and you're good to go.\n\nI haven't even mentioned yet that they also sell cakes, take-home pints, shakes, floats, smoothies and frozen yogurt.\n\nI know, RIGHT?!?!??!\n\nIf you hadn't guessed it already, I'm definitely a fan. In fact, it's 'Ice Cream Break' time! See ya there!","date":"2009-10-13 16:43:06"}

The young lady who did my pedicure was very sweet, attentive and friendly. However, I was supposed to get a manicure as well and what I got was, well...half of that.(hence the 1\/2 star) while getting my pedicure, another young lady came over and grabbed my hand and pulled out the small shelf. Then she put my hand down and walked away for maybe 6 or 7 minutes. She returned with a nail file and I jokingly said \"oh I thought you forgot about me\"...(the look she gave me let me know that she didn't get the joke). She proceeds to file my pinky nail then her friend walks in and she runs to hug her and never returns. My pedicure and massage are done to perfection and I am assisted to the table to get my nails done by a different nail tech who just came in the door for her shift. I assume she will perform the \"actual\" manicure, She doesn't. No massage no cuticle oil no trimming or pushing back of cuticles...I had decided to try the SNS dipping powder and she just jumped right in, proceeded to file my nails and apply the powder. She was very nice as well and very funny as was Danny who was beside us performing color application on another client. The nail tech finished my SNS but the top coat was taking too long to dry and was dull looking. Danny ended up fanning my nails by hand to help them dry then finally had the first girl (who walked away from me) to remove the top coat and apply a gel coat instead and use the UV light to dry it. All in All The finished product looks pretty good, however I've determined that I am not a fan of the SNS powder as it looks thick on my natural nails as if I have chunky acrylic nails and I've never been a fan of those...not their fault, just not my cup of tea but for $70 (plus $15 tip) I should have gotten a complete Manicure.

I ordered two pieces, Gorillas in The Mist and Tree of Truth.  The original art dealer who made our transaction was let go for untold reasons and was replaced by someone else(Mike?).   I only know this because I called to get a follwup on the delivery of the photographs because I have yet to hear from the guy who took over the account.  I think if someone took over the account, they should be taking the initiative to notify the customers of that change.  I basically had been getting no response from the emails I sent to my original dealer, and I had to call to find out what happened.\n\nAbout four weeks later, I received the Tree of Trurth(alternatively called Wisdom Tree).  However, it was only by accident that I received it.  I stopped by my local USPS office to pick up an article by another merchant, and to my surprise the clerk brought me a package from the Rodney Lough Studio.  I have no idea how  long it had been at the USPS office, because I was never notified by Mike, or frankly anyone from this Las Vegas studio that the piece had been shipped out.  I wasn't notified by USPS either, but we all know and expect crappy service from the USPS - the main difference is that I didn't pay USPS thousands of dollars for a certain level of service.  \n\nI am left wondering:\n\nIf Rodney Lough Jr. Sells their pieces of artwork as being something of value and something to treasure...Why would they send it via the UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE like its junk mail??

Something that extends beyond the swipe of the credit card?  \n\nI am glad the Wisdom Tree was not lost or damaged in the USPS office, but I certainly expected better service than I have received.

So its current condition is great in comparison.   The rooms no longer look like photos 11 and 12 posted above. The rest are up to date.\n\n* Positives:  Flat screen TV's on wood laminate TV walls, furniture has been updated since the photos posted, IKEA lighting, temperature controls in each room (but older units), very clean and loved the wood flooring over nasty hotel carpeting.  The current internet rate is $72\/night.  How can you beat that in a central Toronto location? I like that you need to use your room key to move the elevator. This stops strangers from accessing the upper floors as the desk can't see the elevators.  There is a security guard on at night.  A concierge will also be located in the lobby in the future. \n\n* Negatives:  The awful drapery and the bathroom still needs some improvement.  The room is small but no different than any other budget hotel.  The lobby and restaurant are being renovated so you have to deal with that.

We split the Pomme - bacon, cheddar, apple slices with vinaigrette. It was delightful!! Wait staff was helpful and pleasant - until the end. We were unaware that we were not supposed to leave the table to go to the bakery shelf and order some take out. We were scolded a bit - which was fine but rather silly. I mean it's more money in the bank and there was no signage or warning we'd be breaking an unspoken law! Any way - the almond croissant and banana chocolate brioche was little better than average and tasted a day or so old. So, maybe skip that part!","date":"2017-10-24 19:56:37"}

This was a pre-opening tasting, so they're still working on all of the fine points.  Nonetheless, it is a terrific spot.  The structure itself is very appealing, as they restored a 1940's-era building and exposed its beautiful brickwork, which is complimented with a stained concrete floor.  The bar is a proper one with a wide array of liquors and fairly ample seating for the size of the space.  The patio definitely will be the preferred seating choice so long as the weather cooperates.  We tried macaroni and cheese as well as the cole slaw starters; for $3 each, you could make a delicious, reasonably-priced meal from a collection of the starters.  The double dip starter (cobb dip and posole salsa with chips) was very good, though I almost preferred the dip and salsa without the chips because they're so flavorful.  The mixed grain salad was a good choice, too, though I might try to find something other than the orange vinagrette to put on it.  The wine on tap was tasty, and they'll also have a small list of about 8 bottles.  Again, the official opening isn't until the 25th, so they're still honing the fine edges.  In any event, we'll be there far too often for our own good!","date":"2011-04-22 14:18:46"}

Boy was I mistaken.  The parking lot was jammed and therefore forced to eat in the lounge without a reservation.  In the end, probably a better choice.  The lounge, though seperate, actually shares the main dining room's huge picture window view of the heavily forested ravine and Cahoon Creek.  The rustic decorating and dark tones with a glowing fireplace makes you think you might be in a roaring 20's hideaway.  The bartender was a pro - courteous, efficient, \"healthy\" drink pourer.  The lounge menu struck us as pricey at first but fears were quelled when our neighbor's order arrived.  We opted for the steak sandwiches which came with potato or salad. Prepared perfectly and just enough to satisfy. We felt very good about our choices all around.  I was taken by the sheer number of people and traffic when compared to the prices, Cleveland economy and aforementioned new options.  It looks like White Oaks has not changed, serving excellent food and taking caring of its customers.  Definitely worth a re-review upon eating in the main dining room.","date":"2010-01-08 19:58:13"}

Tonight on our way back from the hospital and being Labour Day we thought we would call them to see if they were open. So I got Siri going and got the number. I dialed it and asked if they were open. The lady on the phone said that they were very busy and that I should make a reservation. I did and off we went. When we got there the first clue that something was amiss was that the place was nearly deserted and they could not find my reservation. We took our seat and proceeded to order. Not five minutes into this and we get a call from a local number, it was the first restaurant we called wondering where we were. As it turns out the owners of Cynthia's created a tangent restaurant called Cynthia's Paradise and put it literally right next door. Talk about confusing your market. Given the way the night was going to unfurl we should have packed up and gone next door.\n\nI ordered the Hot and Sour Soup to start. This is one of my favourites and when I looked at the $4.95 price tag I assumed we were going to get a bowl big enough to share. When it came I got this little golden globe before me which revealed inside an even smaller ceramic bowl which if it held 1 cup of soup I would have been amazed. The soup was adequate. It has a nice balance of all the flavours I am used to but in no way was this worth 5 dollars. I mean for just one dollar more at another chinese restaurant I got a bowl of soup so large that it would have filled that little bowl before me 20 times over. What really drove the point home though was the little tiny $3.50 Egg Roll and the 2 HarGow for $4.50. This place was way over priced. So maybe the service was going to be exceptional. I mean, there were more people on the floor, behind the counter and that could be seen in the kitchen than there were patrons sitting at the tables. The 2 HarGow came one at a time in the tiniest steam boxes I have ever seen. We ordered Moo Shu Pork, Chinese Broccoli and the House Special Fried Rice. The food took way longer to get to us than was comfortable for me but taste wise it was very good. Far too expensive but very good. Ended the meal with the Deep Fried Creme Brulee and with a 13% tip the meal came out to $94.75.\n\nFrankly I can think of a number of places that I would like to spend that kind of money for 2 people. Cynthia's Chinese Restaurant is no longer one of those. As a comparison the meal at Cynthia's Paradise would have cost $54 for two people all you can eat. I will do a review of Paradise when I go there but this place will never see another dime from me.","date":"2016-09-06 02:10:35"}

Not very pleasant.\n\nThey don't take reservations but as long as you arrive before 7PM I think you should be fine.\n\nI opted for having their featured dish, a buttermilk fried chicken with coleslaw, biscuit, and collard greens. At first I thought that the chicken was moist but it ended up being somewhat dry. It was a bit on the flavorless side (disappointed). The collard greens were great and so was the biscuit. The coleslaw was very average. They did not win me with that dish.\n\nAft Kitchen and Bar  did not have a cocktail menu but they had a list of available wines. I had a chardonnay from Estrada Creek and the wine also did not wow me. \n\nI don't have any reason to come back there and I quite did not understand what was their strength. Oh well, I don't expect to find bliss at every bite.","date":"2013-05-28 22:52:04"}

She picked out the glitter that was more pricey and didn't even tell me it would be another $5 charge.. I knew it was gonna be extra $5 because I get my nails done all the time & usually get that kind of glitter so I didn't mind but I feel like they should tell a customer ahead of time if there will be more additional charges.. and so when it came to paying she charged me $30 to just change the color without a manicure..

It was yesterday, a day with freezing rain. When I called in and made reservation in the Morning, I didn't think it'd be a full house on a day like this( April snow). I'm so glad that I did when I arrived this hidden gem in a not so busy neighbourhood. \n\nWe ordered cheese Jalapeño for starter, osso buco and braised lamb for main. Everything was delicious!!!! So richly infused with all kinds of spices! The cheese jalapeño looks a little unpleasant under the red neon light, but after the first bite, we are totally sold!! Both osso buco and braised lamb come with tostadas and beans and rice, no need to order separately. The portion was quite generous for two girls, next time we will probably cut one main and do one more starter. \n\nMy only criticism would be the size of the table. For Mexican food, it'd be great if we have a little bigger table for the many dishes. But I understand that it is built upon a small townhouse, won't be able to have so many people if the table is bigger. \n\nAdvise before going: \n\n1,it's going to be fully packed, make your reservation early. \n2, it's going to be loud, don't expect to sit in a quite corner. \n3, ask the waiter for recommendation, they give great tips!","date":"2018-04-15 14:42:51"}

By far the worst experience I have ever had in Vegas. \n\nTypically hotels in Vegas are known for being extremely catering to their guests. This was not the case. Plus the whole hotel looks like absolute crap filled with the scummiest people. \n\nNext, my room was absolutely filthy. There were piss stains running down the toilet to the ground, it also smelled like someone died in my room. The bed felt like I should have brought a black light and possibly a hazmat suit. Best part about my room was the AC actually working, but the shower\/tub looked like someone had just washed their cars undercarriage in it. The towels felt like sand paper and were barely large enough to be considered bath towels....more like hand towels. Getting a cab is nearly impossible since no where does it say you are required to tell the front desk to call a cab or just call it yourself, since they don't employ someone at the entrance to wave cabs for you. Their room service isn't insanely over priced like most Vegas hotels, but there's a reason for that, everything tastes like it had been made 24-48 hours earlier.\n\nLastly and most importantly, after surviving 3 nights in this dump, I was brushing my teeth the following morning when I noticed a fairly large cockroach scamper across the sink.\n\nAfter all this I literally slept at my friends hotel the final night to avoid puking in my own mouth or getting some rare form of malaria.\n\nIf I told you how much I paid to stay at this sh*thole, you would kick me in the d*ck for being such a dumbass. \n\nIn the end I feel like I got raped for my hard earned cash just so I could save a little.

I went here for dinner with a family member on a Wednesday night - as a result the place was pretty quiet when we arrived. After checking our coats (this is more or less mandatory as they don't let you drape them over the chairs) we were seated at one of their comfy downstairs lounge tables, and we explored the menu, ordered, and proceeded to enjoy an excellent meal.\n\nFirstly, there was the fresh free bread with oil and balsamic for dipping. I was quite hungry so this was a great start. One note, though - beware the spicy bread! We're pretty sure jalapenos were baked into a couple pieces. Tasty for some, not ideal for people like me though.\n\nThen there was the drinks. My dining companion ordered a blackberry Cosmo (made with ingredients like blackberry moonshine - quite a nice touch), and I ordered the Starburst. Both of these drinks were superb; the Cosmo was a first-rate drink and oddly enough, my Starburst did indeed remind me of Starburst candies - but was still muuuuch tastier!\n\nAs for the food - just, YUM! My companion ordered tomato soup and a pear salad. The salad was flavorful (though pretty standard in terms of salad ingredients), and the tomato soup was simply amazing - in addition to its freshness and being the perfect thickness it came with grilled cheese sandwich squares instead of croutons. More restaurants need to do this with their tomato soup, it was just so good! As for me, I ordered the 2015 restaurant week special - hen with bacon mac and cheese and a side of kale - and this was simply divine. I have yet to find such tender, juicy and well seasoned chicken in the city, plus the mac and cheese wasn't overly cheesy and had the bacon flavor infused into it. The result was that it wasn't too rich and it went well with my chicken and kale. The entire meal was also served with a side of tomato gravy, which was basically a thicker version of the tomato soup I'd sampled and fallen in love with already. I couldn't have been happier with what I ordered.\n\nThe clincher for our excellent meal was the fantastic service we received throughout the night. All in all we thought Savoy had amazing food, fantastic staff and a very chill but warm atmosphere. We would absolutely come back - hopefully my next meal here will involve sampling the amazing looking brunch menu!","date":"2015-01-18 18:49:53"}

I just purchased a 2011 Chevrolet Malibu from this dealership, and I went here after work to pick up the green slip so I can register the car with the DMV. \nTIP: Customers who buy or lease vehicles here: DO NOT have to go to the DMV to register your vehicle. You simply use the dealerships control number on the green slip to enter in the DMV website and it will bring up the vehicle you bought. You can then transfer or request new plates (standard only plates) and the DMV will mail them to you. This is handy, because we ALL hate the DMV. \n\nBack to my review of AutoNation Buick GMC of West Sahara round 2. So I got the green slip and I was \"just looking\" at some of the Buicks on the lot. Buick has come along way in the last 10 years or so. This is NOT your grandfather's or grandmother's Buick anymore. I had a 2013 LEXUS ES 300h that got 39MPG highway and 40MPG city. It had quite a few bells and wistles. Anyway, I began by driving a V6 powered 2016 Buick Lacrosse and Devon and Denzell were my points of contact again. I really liked it. This one didn't have the same equipment that my Lexus does, so I didn't really want this particular car, as I didn't want to go down in car quality or caliber. Then I drove a 2014 Chevrolet Impala V6, and loaded with everything for that model year with 22k miles and they were asking 25k for it. I really liked this car. It wasn't a Lexus or a Buick, but it was cheaper than either one of those and it was fully loaded. But I was contemplating replacing my business car, which was my Lexus, and I already had a V6 powered Malibu that I bought for 16k with 32.5k miles two weeks earlier from this same dealership, and the same sales people (Devin and Denzell). It took me forever to decide even after driving a brand new 2015 Buick Lacrosse that had just about everything my Lexus did minus the front parking sensors and the dash cam, but I can replace the dash cam later (which I will at this dealership for both my Malibu and Lacrosse). I got a Heads Up display system with forward collision alert, I got a Bose audio system, a panoramic sun roof, remote starter system, and a wifi hotspot powered by onstar. These features my Lexus didn't have. \n\nI was given multiple options, and a lot of time to decide which vehicle I wanted out of the three, the Chevrolet Impala, or the 2015 V4 eAssist Buick or the 2016 V6 Buick. I ultimately chose the 2015 eAssist V4 Buick Lacrosse based upon what I was going to be doing with the car, showing Real Estate. I was offered an unbelieveable deal too. Because this vehicle was a 2015, and was sitting in the showroom, and the 2016's were already here and more were coming, this car was priced at 35k. Originally it was 41k which was understandable. If I bought my Lexus ES 300h brand new, it would have been 47k easy. I know cars, and how to shop for the ones I like or want. So I knew I was getting a deal on this new car. Also, I was given a 2k tax credit for my Lexus, and AutoNation gave me another $800.00 off on the car, because I am a repeat buyer, and I didn't waste anyone's time. Thank you David! \n\nSo I still had 1k of negative equity to deal with, and that was done by lowering my interest rate from 4.9% with Lexus to 3.9% through AutoNation Buick GMC's contacts. Can you say Credit Unions anyone? If you want great financing go see the fine people at AutoNation Buick GMC, they WILL find you a good deal, if it takes all day. They don't just use traditional banks or manufacturer banks like most dealerships do, which all charge higher interest rates, trust me I've been there. \n\nSo in combination of lowering the interest rate again to 3.45%, and further dropping the price of the new 2015 Buick Lacrosse, I wrapped up my negative equity and came UP about 2k. This shows in the contract as down payment money which is true because I verified how the dealership got the numbers. So I got a brand new Buick Lacrosse, with an extended warranty, prepaid oil changes for 3 years on top of the 2 years given to you by GM (General Motors), theft protection and GAP insurance and my payments are $616.00 per month versus $647.00 a month with Lexus without the theft protection, or the prepaid maintance plans. Lexus doesn't offer standard oil changes for the first 2 years either. \n\nWhat's more, my Buicks engine, transmission, and final point of assembly are in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Just like my 2011 Chevrolet Malibu. The major components of these cars are made here. Just read the window sticker, it will tell you where the major components are made. We need jobs in this country badly. I don't need Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump to \"bring back the jobs\" to the United States. We can all do our part by giving GM, Ford or even Fiat Chrysler a chance. Personally, I am a GM man. I loved my Lexus, but I love my country, my Buick, and the sales team at AutoNation Buick GMC even more. They also hire the veterans! Thank you again everyone @ AutoNation!","date":"2016-04-11 18:23:24"}

After being placed on hold for over 30 min, she told me that they would only be able to credit back $8 and not the full $11.52 because the other $3.52 was included in taxes.  Another representative called back to tell me that the company would have to call the car rental location and verify that the car was brought back on full before I could receive the other $3.52.

Like life or death people.\n\nWHAT I GOT: Cheese ribs\n\nPROS: Repeat after me. You can NEVER go wrong with meat and cheese. EVER. And my goodness, James Cheese Back Ribs is winning the restaurant game. You get a pool of gooey cheese that the server wraps around each rib along with extra corn, two different mashes (sweet potato and regular potato), mini sausages, and scrambled eggs. The ribs themselves were coated in this beautiful and super flavorful sauce, and the meat was super tender as well. Literally fell off the bone with one bite. They also give you scissors and some plastic gloves to keep your hands clean, along with the option to choose the heat level of your ribs. We went with mild, which honestly is not spicy at all, so if you're looking for even a little bit of a kick, I would suggest the regular spicy option.\n\nCONS: Ok well the price is pretty hefty. Not gonna lie. And the sides aren't exactly the most tasty things ever but combined with the cheese, usually anything will taste good. But be warned, the server will turn off the gas stove that melts the cheese once all the ribs are wrapped so the cheese will start to get hard again. If you wanna dip your sides, eat those first. And the ribs are a bit on the small side so this meal won't actually fill you up, if that's what you're looking for.","date":"2017-10-02 02:17:24"}

PEKING MAN in large, faux-Asian font on a bright red back drop. That's definitely a holdover from the 70s or 80s. After struggling to find an actual entrance (you see, it may be listed as being on Sheppard, but you have to turn on Ambrose to actually get to the storefront. If you're heading east and miss Ambrose, there's no chance to U-turn til Leslie, unless you want to run over city-owned flowers in the median.), we finally parked the car in front of some convenience store in the same strip mall\/mini-industrial park building area. Given the PEKING MAN sign is all you can see from the main road, I don't know how other businesses can persist here. \n\nThe moment we went past the doors, we were greeted with a motorcycle arcade machine. What is this, Chuck E. Chan? Ah ha, ha., there's a Chuck E. Cheese down the road. A waitress came up and we were promptly seated and presented with these ghastly menus, with cartoon depictions of, presumably, a Peking man in various states of labour (labour as in work, not Chinamen giving birth!).\n\nOn to the food! A family of five orders the following for dinner: Bamboo and Dried Scallop Soup, Deep-fried Soft Shell Crab, Peking Duck Special, Lobster fried in salt and pepper, and Shanghai Noodles with beef. I'll spare you the details, because there are no details. It was all bland. It was as if everything was frozen for Walt Disney's first meal after being brought back to life from his cryogenic sleep. The soup wasn't watered down, but it tasted like it was. The crab and the lobster were fried in the same tasteless junk probably used to grease door hinges. The duck was somewhat of a saving grace. First course, slightly crispy duck skin (though not nearly crispy enough to my liking), with fine slices of duck meat, to be wrapped in rice paper. Spare yourself from attack of the living bland and eat the duck straight up without the wrapping. Second course, stir-fried duck meat. More meh. Basically, anything these guys actually cook gets turned from gold into lead.\n\nAriel G. may want to take that trip down memory lane, but this meal was a memory I'd rather repress.","date":"2009-10-14 05:44:40"}

EXTREME pain right now. Got a Saturday ( today visit). I told the front desk BEFORE I went back that I didn't get paid until Wednesday ( a few days), and that I just paid to fix my roof so money is tight. After being examined and X rayed they explained what they could do and that my portion would be $160. They weren't sure they could even help m today as Phan's schedule was tight. I told them I could only pay $100 today. I was told by their office manager they don't do payment plans , they could try and get me some dental credit plan. I told them I didn't want to do that. It was $160 today or nothing. I told them I was unable to do that. So I came in pain , left in pain- they did nothing for me - I offered to pay my bill (around $60) as I left. They wanted to bill my insurance etc but I didn't want to hear from them again so I insisted I pay it all now because I wanted nothing to do with them ( contact me after insurance etc). . I complained  and to shut me up they wiped the bill clean. \n\nThey are all about the money. My $100 today plus insurance ( and $60 in 3 business days) wasn't enough to help me. Forget about helping me because I was in pain - they did nothing - nothing - they wouldn't even do it for 2\/3 my portion today , the rest in a few days ( as well as gouging my  insurance) \n\nTHEY ARE ALL ABOUT THE MONEY. They don't care if you hurt. They are very high tech - and I understand they need to pay off all their high tech equipment - \n\nMy opinion : Pham sucks! Palo verde dental sucks!  \n\nCame in pain , left in pain - they use your pain to extort money from you. It's just white collar crime - they knew exactly my finances before I even went to a room , and then after exam it was \"pay up or get out\" - the officer manager specifically said \"we do not do payment plans\". \n\nThey wasted my one day off when I could have found someone who would help me when I am in severe pain \n\n\n===== \n\nAddendum 7\/1\/16 \n\nYep ...

Planning on tossing a few back? Grab a few before going in; Outside at a slot \/ table rum & coke - $1 (tip) \/ Inside bar rum & coke - $12 w\/o tip.. I'm just sayin'.. I haven't been during happy hour, as it seems the place is bursting at the seems waiting for a Fire Marshall to be called. It might be best to go during that hour or so if you're trying to have more than one beverage at this place. \n\nAnyways, it's a dueling piano bar with two fella's who know all the bangin' hits from the 50's all the way up to today's Top 40. A patron can request a song (once one ends and \/ or hasn't been interrupted) and if someone in the crowd isn't pleased - he or she then has the opportunity to walk up to the the non-playing pianist, offer a cash tip of higher cash value than that placed prior and have the song changed on the spot.. keeping both the patrons and musicians on their toes. It's really an interactive environment - in the sense that the pianists continuously receive requests, talk to the crowd, with the crowd itself shootin' the breeze, minglin', singing and dancing if they know the jam being performed. If you can't see the performers, they have tv's lined up throughout the bar so you can catch a glimpse. I'm not the tallest human, so it's often I end up in somebody's armpit while they're singing their favorite track and I'm gasping for air. Kidding, I'm actually the guy who has YOU in the headlock; You'll be blissfully swept away by my beautiful renditions of Bohemian Rhapsody, I Want You To Want Me & my jam - One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer in an overtly joyous manner. \n\n*They also have that lady you see at all the shows.. she dances & looks like Dee from It's Always Sunny, tries to get you to boogey with her and you can't understand what she's saying, though, she sings every song on cue without a slur.  She's an interesting human who needs help, so you push her towards the random person next to you hoping they'll do something about it. Do some people observing and find em'! \n\nThis is a place of action, sound and movement. You might get bumped or pulled to dance and sing. Good music and a giddy buzz is found at the Bar At Times Square; so be forewarned - most people here are on a good one and are trying to maintain that vibe! Don't get upset if someone just wants to sing with you btw - it's probably me!","date":"2015-03-18 19:12:29"}

I bought 2 Groupons and waited two weeks to get my pre-paid for appointment (1 set for one house 2nd set for another). #1 was scheduled for a Thurs-Fri two weeks later and house #2 the third Thurs-Fri. I got a call from Jimmy on Mon-Tues of the Thurs before House #1 was to be completed putting me off another  week (now we're in week 3).  I had two potential buyers come by that weekend to see house #1. They went with the other house on my block because of my ugly brown paint (that I had scheduled to be done)!\n\nFinally my long-awaited for Thursday came and Jimmy showed up with two men promptly at 7:00 and gave me the trip charge, charge for baseboards, and for an extra room.  It was VERY fair.  The men did a good job... maybe an 8-9 and cleaned up well.  They had to schedule my 2nd house for Saturday (I had told Jimmy I'd need 4 full days - two for each house). He did not come out to give the men direction for house #2 on Saturday or give me the price of things the groupon didn't cover  (I had high ceilings in both houses and needed an extra room done, wall paper removed from one small wall, etc.)  \n\nHe finally came out Monday around Noon to quote prices on #2 (again reasonable) but his men were upset that he hadn't shown up either morning to give them direction.  Plus the men had some conflicts with my handyman.  The men disappeared Mon around 12:30 - they got back at 2:30ish and left by 3:30 with the RR undone and wallpaper stuck on the tub and counters (from the removal) of my bathroom. The baseboards were done poorly, paint dripping was all over the tub, counters and floors and 2nd coat was never completed.  \n\nJimmy told me that he'd come finish the job - said I was getting the \"best of the best.\"  Because I wanted a slight color alteration (lighter) in the RR, he told me there would be a charge and a small charge for one other wall.  Once the paint had dried, I realized that Jimmy had not cut in the new color or cleaned up the wall paper and paint drippings from his men. He also didn't redo the messy baseboards.  My handymen and I were shocked by Jimmy's paint job (drips, no cutting in, unfinished baseboards). Then Jimmy called and asked me to have my handymen bring him his forgotten ladder??? What?\n\nBotton line... Groupons appear to be LAST priority for timing and you'll be paying weeks before you get the work.  They may also send you new, untested employees (my two workers told me I was their first project with Jimmy).","date":"2015-08-19 05:17:03"}

But there are also some issues.\n\nThe ambiance is bright and colorful, with high ceilings, lots of windows, and an impressive bar.  But the tables were packed in pretty tight.  Hey, I understand why.  The place was full on a Tuesday night!  If you can cram that many people into a space, and they still want to come, then it's just smart business.  But it isn't my taste.\n\nMy wife and I decided to try as many dishes as we could, so we shared a menu made up of appetizers and side dishes.  Our server was friendly and helpful, but he did not bring out the dishes in the order we requested.\n\nSome dishes were what you might call \"just fine\":  The chopped salad, the blue corn pancake, and the double-baked potato.  The goat cheese queso fundido was better than \"just fine.\"  The chile relleno and the tiger shrimp were both spectacularly good - snapping with unique flavors.  The smoked chicken quesadilla, on the other hand, was sub-par and not very flavorful.\n\nSo, Mesa is a perfectly acceptable restaurant.  But when we go to a high end, pricey restaurant we really want nothing less than five stars, and Mesa doesn't quite get there.  Lots of Vegas restaurants do get there.  So we won't be back at Mesa for a while.  Sorry, Bobby.  We'll catch you at Bar Americain next time we're in New York.","date":"2015-11-18 18:59:44"}

You can also order food while soaking up the sun and alcohol.\n\nThe hotel rooms are clean, semi-quiet, but very small. For the price you pay to stay at this hotel, they sure give you a tiny room. But the service outshines the room so I can bear with it. The pool area becomes a club\/lounge at night, and you can hear the music from your room (thump thump thump).

I've been waiting since 9:30 am and its now 2:00 for a call back for a simple precipitation and nobody can give me a answer. After my first trimester I am leaving this place. The first nurse I saw was nice but not a people person which made my first visit uncomfortable. I suggested things to her to make my blood work done, she should have just brought it up. Anyways I hope to have good things to say but at this moment I don't and am very displeased with the service everyone's experience is different this was mine.","date":"2015-03-04 22:25:03"}

My girlfriend and I were craving pasta tonight, so we resorted to Yelp and found this place in the nearby. We ordered the Penne Al Vodka and the Baked Lasagna take-out.\n\nWhen I got to the place, I was a little skeptical as there werent any customers. The place looked cozy and comfortable though! Got the food and brought it home. Had a taste and we were extremely impressed. This is a true definition of \"You can't judge a book by it's cover\". The food tasted fresh and homemade. I was so relieved that I didn't see a lot of steam when I opened the box, as that usually means the food was microwaved. \n\nI will say though, the online menu prices are outdated.

Their outdoor patio is delightful on warm summer evenings, and the inside, while dimly lit and a bit hipster-y, nevertheless feels welcoming and cozy. The menu is written with a heavy dose of sass and snark, which makes it a fun read. Who wants to order boring old chicken tenders when you can order \"Britney Spears\"? I should probably look into hiring their menu writer to help me jazz up my tech reports for work.\n\nAnyway, I've ordered many things here, and their food is usually solid. My favorite meal begins with a plate of their \"church basement pierogies.\" They cook up a legit pierogie, with a soft, tender shell browned to perfection and housing a ton of delicious, fluffy, flavorful potato and cheese filling. They are *almost* as good as actual church basement pierogies. Then I like to wash down my pierogies with an order of their mac and cheese topped with blackened chicken. Their mac is addictive -- creamy, rich, cheesy and topped with crunchy breadcrumbs. I really like the blackened chicken paired with the mac, as the spicy cajun seasoning on the chicken cuts through the fattiness of the cheese sauce quite nicely. Supremely delicious. I will admit that once in a blue moon the mac and cheese will be a bit dry, which is a bummer. So the consistency is not 100% there. But nine times out of ten, I'm graced with a good amount of cheese sauce and I'm a happy camper. And then I pass out in a carb-induced coma.\n\nThe downside here is, of course, their prices. They are pretty expensive. I recently got my standard pierogies-and-mac meal for take out after not having visited for awhile, and I had forgotten just how pricey they are (it was $25 + tip for my meal for take out).  So be prepared to have your wallet cry a little, but the mac and cheese should help cheer it up.","date":"2015-04-01 20:26:40"}

I was encouraged to go again,  which I did,  yesterday with a group of 8 people.  To start,  they would not sit us because we only had 6, the other two gals were on their way. The restaurant was pretty empty,  but they stated they had other reservations.  I never saw a group of 8 come,  so. ..our table should have been available anyway.  We would have ordered many more drinks but instead we had one, two at the most.  The guy that finally decided to sit us was not very nice,  and rudely said \"come on! \" to which I responded that we weren't a bunch of cows being herd to our table. He didn't say anything.  Our server was alright,  her voice was a bit much on the ears, have you heard of voice fry? The food,  great, guacamole and queso fundido were tasty. The tacos great as expected, the mijito, though  not on the menu was well done. We came during happy hour,  but when checks came the bill didn't reflect that. The waitress seemed annoyed when we asked about it.  We are by no means a difficult or demanding group. So I am inclined to think it's an attitude issue on their part. I was  completely done with the experience when a plate load crashes on the floor. It falls from the hands of one of servers. It was literally next to us,  soooo loud,  pieces flying,  and not a word to apologize or something!? We weren't offered desert and at that point I was too bothered to stay longer.  I said bye and thank you as I walked out,  but there was no response from the staff. So maybe I'll go again,  to eat tacos because they are truly amazing but I am now even more sad that Gallo Blanco is gone. .. the charm,  atmosphere,  attentive service is clearly not at this but the Otro (other) restaurant.

Let me just narrow down this review to our latest experience (hub's bday - and btw, I know he's not my hubs yet, but it's way easier and a lot less annoying to type, IMO).\n\nSome highlights: the bartenders are so nice and SO talented. Their juleps are to die for!\n\nNext, the apps: you shouldn't come here if you're not planning on getting appetizers. Just turn around and go home. The Fried Chicken Skins are unreal. Think about the best part of friend chicken, and then imagine having JUST that on a plate covered in spicy honey sauce. I die.\n\nOn to entrees: you can't go wrong with both styled of fried chicken. I always go for the Tennessee Hot because I like a little bit o' spice and the sauce is killer, but my hubs goes the Umbrian style (your regular run of the mill fried chicken) and it's equally delicious and fall-off-the-bone.\n\nLastly, and truly I'm saving the best for last, dessert: You have two options: you need to either go for the pie or go for the donut...\n\nThe pie is from Pie Snob (if you don't know about Pie Snob, look it up on Yelp RIGHT NOW, and then order an apple pie, and then thank me later).\n\nThe donut and pure caramel heaven. It's drenched (not drizzled) in the most delectable caramel sauce I've ever tasted, with just a pinch of sea salt to top it off. *drooling*\n\nOne pro tip before you come to Okra, since you're obviously making a reservation this very minute: it's a little hard to find.

They did well, but felt I pretty bad for the other tables.\n\nThe brunch menu was large, but mostly it was just slight variations on eggs and meat with some major exceptions.

It is expensive, but not more expensive than the other upscale restaurants in the Palazzo\/Venetian complex.  We also know this is Mr. Keller's \"bistro\" play, it has been much documented.  And I love French bistro food, my favorite kind on earth.  So 2 stars?  Here's why:\n\nService: At these prices you expect excellent service.  We had two tables of 8 each, next to each other, and all I can say is that the service was no better than what you would hope to receive at a Chili's.  Timing was off, smiles were rare, it took forever to deliver a glass of cranberry juice to the one person not drinking wine.  Clean-up was either too early or too late.  Just a mess.  Unacceptable at a restaurant of this rep.\n\nFood:  Yes, pommes frites are a staple of bistros, and Bouchon is known for theirs, but the volume of fries was overwhelming.  At the end of the meal we all sat looking around and laughing at the endless piles of frites that nobody could finish.  I had a flatiron steak, asked for it medium rare, it arrived well done.  I could have sent it back, but given the service I didn't want to chance it, so chewed (and chewed and chewed) it down.  Steak quality was mediocre.  Had a endive\/watercress salad that truly was nothing special.  The walnut vinaigrette did nothing to enhance the bitter endive, think it made it worse.  Ostensibly there was some Roquefort cheese in the salad, but about 4 little nibbles, added nothing to the rest of the salad - disintegrated.  I know times are tight, but this is a double digit priced salad, c'mon.  Nobody raved about their entree, in fact, I think people were expecting something special and kind of stared at what was delivered.\n\nWine:  A pretty fair list, and while not reasonably priced, I've seen more outrageous pricing elsewhere.  But it was predictable, mainly French, with a nice representation from the major regions, but nothing unique or intriguing.  Very safe list.  If this is a bistro there should be some more fun, and less pricey, bistro-y choices like Cru Bourgeois from Bordeaux, a longer list of Provencal wines, some unique choices from Cali.  I could have put this list together in my sleep, and the sommelier and wine service was pretty sleepy and sloppy as well.\n\nI've been here for breakfast\/brunch, and I guess this is their speciality, it was super, a 4 or maybe 5 star breakfast, love that.

First, let me give you some context:\n\n1. This is not the place to come for authentic Chinese cuisine. Abort mission if that's your goal. Go somewhere with a name that you can barely understand.\n\n2. This is not the place to come for personalized service and attention, especially not at 2am on a weekend. You will be treated like what you probably are - a starving drunk person just as likely to skip out on your bill as you are to vomit on their floor. \n\nSeriously - these folks put up with a lot. A LOT. Can you imagine taking care of hundreds of drunken morons every single night for the entire weekend? It'd be like babysitting 100 children with ADHD who are also carrying loaded pistols and have an undeniable urge to hump on your white tablecloths. So I chose to cut them some slack.\n\n3. I liken this to being the Denny's of Chinese food. It is greasy, unhealthy and oh-so-delicious. You love it while your eating it. You tell yourself it's the greatest meal you've ever had in your life and you want to marry it.\n\nBut in 15 minutes it's going to sit like a stone in your stomach and you will question every ounce of your judgment. If you can survive this brief period of remorse, your overall experience will come out on the positive.\n\n4. On a diet? Yeah, no. Not for you.\n\nYes, I too have been part of the raucous crowd that convenes here late at night after a night out in the Beltline. I have slithered their noodles down my throat and I have savored the juices of their finest ginger beef. I literally can't imagine coming here for a sit down meal at any other time.\n\nI've also come here for the lunch buffet - as take out. The place isn't quite as fun when the disco ball isn't a-glowin'. Now if you're a student, a cheapskate or a person in need of large quantities of food (as much as you can physically force into a styrofoam container) - this place is a great option come lunchtime. Just make sure you bring CASH. They get a bit ornery if you try to pay with Debit\/Credit.\n\nPro tip: Stuff as much as you can into your styrofoam container and just hold it shut, even if it won't close naturally. You might get dirty looks, but I've never been yelled at - yet. Mmmmm, 5 pounds of Calgary's finest imitation Asian cuisine. \n\nIs 4 stars probably pushing it? Yes. If I could I'd give them a 3.5. But as someone else mentioned, Calgary owes these fine folks a bit of thanks for giving us an option other than late night pizza or microwaved Alphaghetti.","date":"2011-11-30 07:11:58"}

The very small, packed place that has the run of the mill sushi, the convert belt sushi, or the fancy schmancy type with renamed sushi rolls and a few not so common.   \n\nIn my view Kofusion is, at least this location is the fancy schmancy type and the prices to go with it.   Nonetheless they have some unique rolls and have more than just sushi.    So if you have friends who are adverse to raw seafood, they'll be able to find items such as hibachi chicken or beef, along with rice or noodle dishes.   \n\nThe service was, just okay.  For as few people there were at the time we visited, I felt the service could have been far better.  My suspicion is the kid was nursing a hangover, but he was friendly and he did get our order right.   \n\nAs with most sushi places, when the two platters of sushi rolls came to the table they presented well and certainly there was pride in the work.   The rolls were nice and tight and didn't fall apart from plate to mouth.  The fish, especially the salmon was very fresh and I liked the special sauce used on the spicy tuna.    \n\nI would certainly come back here again, although if you've not been to the Mongolian place just up the road, I would suggest giving that a try too.  Both places are excellent.  \n\nOne other point.  If you happen to be over by the collage, there is a small Kofusion place by the Music hall.

Not only did the wash on the outside look horrible, they barely wiped down the front seats, doors, and dash, they also didnt wipe anything in the back.

So, this past weekend, it went in. They took 5 hours to detail the car. I was expecting it to take between 3-4 like they had originally told me, but, that was just the start of the frustration. I paid to have the car detailed with a clay bar to remove swirl marks and find scratches. There are now more swirl marks on my car than when it went in, not all of the wax was removed, so I had to use my microfiber cloths to remove it myself, I specifically said that I DIDNT want any armorall or leather conditioner on my interior, and to just clay bar the outside, they didnt listen to that, so I spent 30 minutes wiping greasy armorall off my interior and leather. I told the manager that I was completely dissatisfied with the job that was done, he refused to give me any money back and said I would have to bring it back for them to do the job again.

We asked the waiter's advice as to which cheeses to choose and his reco was excellent.  Each cheese comes with its own condiment so we had a baby mozzarella with a rhubarb compote, a paresan with strawberry and another cheese which I can't remember with marmelade - fantastic!\n\nFor my main, I had the gnocchi which was really good and my friend had some kind of pasta with lemon and ricotta (she really liked it but it wasn't my thing).  Both were around $20\n\nWe wanted a little something extra so we split a trio of sorbet - bergamot, rhubarb and mango - the rhubarb was my favourite\n\nAll in all, a great night.  The service was excellent, the room was really nice and the food was awesome (and reasonably priced).  My only complaint was that our cocktails were really small and didn't appear to have much alcohol in them.  I'd stick to wine if I went again.","date":"2011-05-27 13:08:27"}

They have a great selection of wines from different countries and their food options are not overwhelming, but always deliver big.

Check in was reasonable and the staff are friendly. At first I was taken back by the mandatory valet, but I like that it's based on gratuity\/tip. I love that it's smoke free and still basically on the strip. The one bedroom suite is super spacious and could honestly comfortably fit four adults if tight on cash. Rom service provides good portions for the money and is prompt. So the markdowns come for the cleaning and the gym. There were two obvious strains on the curtains, which I know if I can see, housekeeping should be able to and thus CLEAN! Also, I was curious as to why there were a pair of men's dress shoes under the bed. Did housekeeping vacuum under the bed??? Clean with their eyes closed?? I dunno. Also, my friend went to get extra pillows from the closet and said there was hair on them and they were dirty...not acceptable. Lastly, I do workout everywhere and was slightly disappointed from the size of the gym. I was still able to get a mini workout in, but I guess I was expecting more variety and no kids.

If this sort of unabashed adulation makes you uncomfortable, you might want to turn away now. You have been warned. \n\nI HAVE NEVER HAD A BETTER BRUNCH EXPERIENCE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!  The White Brick Kitchen really knows what they're doing and I don't have even one solitary complaint (and, believe me, I'm very picky and thoroughly enjoy complaining when it's warranted - so I would if I could, but I honestly can't).  Allow me to regale you all with the delicious tale of my delightful brunch. \n\nMy friend and I were fearful that we would have to wait for a table when we arrived at 10 am on a Sunday.  It was such a pleasant surprise when we were seated immediately and quickly presented with both coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very welcoming, laid-back and cozy.  I already felt very content as I sipped my OJ, little did I know that I was about to be sky rocketed from content to off-the-charts-euphoric.  It seemed as though we had only just placed our orders for the Scotch-ish Eggs when they were set before us, as if by magic. The service was so fast that it verged on ridiculous, but the quality of the food did not suffer in the least.  On paper, the Scotch-ish Eggs sound super tasty (two panko fried soft boiled eggs, hollandaise, greens, buttered baguette and potatoes), but nothing can fully prepare you for how transcendent this dish truly is.  I am awestruck by how perfectly cooked the soft-boiled eggs were in spite of the fact that they were breaded in panko and deep fried.  I have no idea how they still manage to maintain the optimal runny yolk consistency while creating such a crispy coating on the outside of the egg; it's nothing short of incredible.  Every component of the meal was outstanding - from the dressing with a subtle hint of Parmesan on the salad to the golden brown potatoes.  I can't say enough good things about this dish, you really have to try it!\n\nI'm excited to return to The White Brick Kitchen soon to try their other dishes (if they're anything like the Scotch-ish Eggs, I am definitely in for a treat).  I loved that even though they're offering high-quality food, the prices are very reasonable.  Great spot, great staff and sublime food. You really cannot ask for more!","date":"2013-01-02 18:17:53"}

It was good.  Next out were the onion rings -- about 8-10 rings of various sizes, and Ranch dressing as a dipping sauce.   The onion rings were pretty greasy, as I suppose most are, so I'm not complaining, however I do expect a big stomach-ache from them at any moment -- hopefully I'll be home by then!   I do wish more places would get rid of (more of) the grease before serving onion rings, or set them down atop a diaper or something! \n\nThe pasta course was good.  Instead of them bringing Parmesan cheese on the side, the entree came with it already atop the pasta -- fine for me, but beware, if you don't want cheese.   Also included with the pasta entree were two fresh garlic bread sticks -- they were very handy in absorbing the excess liquid in the bowl of pasta.\n\nI was sad but not surprised to see that instead of deducting a dollar or two off the price of Meatballs & Spaghetti ($8.99) since I asked for pasta & sauce without the meatballs, I was charged full price.\n\nMy bottom line:  Decent food at an OK price & good, friendly service, but neither the casino (I don't gamble) nor the restaurant will be a 'destination' for me -- I came here because I was curious, my curiosity is now satisfied, and I don't see a reason to return.

As in, it is hell. Pure hell.\n\nBelieve you me, I love a good shopping mall as much as the next gal, but I avoid the Eaton Centre like the plague. Oh Eaton Centre, how do I hate thee? Let me count the ways:\n\n1) Teeming with truant teenagers and tired tourists, travelling through the mall itself is a true testament to tenacity. The layout of the centre is confusing, and combined with the constant crowds, navigation can be complicated and challenging (cue applause). \n\n2) It is said that \"variety is the spice of life.\" Consider that the Eaton Centre has 3 Aldos, 2 Bell Worlds, 2 Feet Firsts, 2 Nutrition Houses, and 2 Sunglass Huts, to name a few. Is this really necessary? Is it a secret ploy by the city of Toronto to encourage everyone to be getting proper nutrition while rocking fabulous footwear, sporting sunglasses and chatting on a cell phone? \n\n3) The one redeeming quality of the Eaton Centre - the prime, central location - is also, in several ways, its downfall. Parking is expensive. Hordes of people travelling to and from Dundas and Queen stations and the PATH converge here. Trying to hunt for deals isn't easy when battling major pedestrian traffic.  \n\n4) The washrooms - if you can find one, that is - are always in high demand. High demand washrooms equate to dutty, dutty washrooms.\n\nFor decent mall shopping, Yorkdale is just a hop and a skip away by subway, and is far less congested with pretty much the same (if not better) selection of stores.","date":"2011-05-27 21:08:20"}

My office recently relocated to King St. E, and I looked for a salon within walking distance - finally landing on McManus and Campbell in the Distillery district. I booked an appointment with Sharon McManus (one of the owners). She listened to my concerns and helped me pick a cool ash tone out of a book of samples.

A sweet black lab named Rita who they rescued from Mexico I believe.

However, our experience was quite disappointing.\n\nThe 20 minute wait to be seated was completely reasonable. But the 20 minute wait to get our order taken and then the 40 minutes it took them to prepare 2 sandwiches, a bowl of soup, and one pastry is unspeakable for such a high-end restaurant. We were wondering what took them so long to prepare our food and then realized it was so they could turn a \"medium rare\" steak sandwich into an overcooked piece of wood. We probably would have sent it back, but it would have taken another 40 minutes and we were very hungry by that point.\n\nOur waitress did not offer much detail or information about the menu to our group, which was clearly not well-versed in French. She was also very slow to refill our water glasses, and when she did, the water was lukewarm. I was wondering if this was a French thing, but saw that other tables were offered pitchers of ice water.\n\nGlad I decided to eat an egg and cheese biscuit in the Venetian food court before heading up and waiting an hour to eat a $10 cup of soup in Bouchon.","date":"2013-09-04 02:00:58"}

I deeply felt I was treated unfair and discriminated either because of my race, or because the purpose of my visit was to fix the glasses's problems.\n\nInstead of fixing the problem of the eye glasses they provided, the male manager would prefer to spend time on getting new customers. I went to Lenscrafters to fix a problem of my new glasses and unfortunately it was a busy day for them. He said to me that he would recommend me to come another day because they were busy. Before and after he said this to me, he didn't say the same words to all other customers who needed to get a new glasses or to pick up a glasses. He quickly assigned them (many people came after me) to specialists' tables and let me wait at the shopping area for 30 minutes. Was that because I was Asian, or because he didn't taking my request(fixing the problem of the glasses) seriously? Both.\n\nWhat the female manager only cared about was getting you out of there as quick as she can and getting more customers. The third time I went there to pick up an adjusted glasses, the female manager assigned me to a specialist's table. I had been waiting for 20mins at the table, which I thought it was totally ok because they were busy. However, when a specialist finally came to me and started to help me to adjust my glasses, the female manager came to talk to the specialist right away and said \"after you get this done, I want you to go to another table.\" She pointed at the table where two white female customers JUST CAME 1 minute ago. That specialist hadn't even started helping me yet and I could sense that he felt awkward, too. He was nice and tried his best to adjust my glasses. During this time, the female manager came twice to our table to rush him go to another table to serve the white ladies. I ignored her and kept talking with the specialist about my glasses. I needed to get my glasses adjusted right since that was the second time to fix this problem. The female manager kept standing 1 meter away from our table and starring at us the whole time. I guess to this female manager, white customers were more important, their time was more valuable and they should not be waiting for a \"long\" time. Therefore she believed that she could rudely and frequently interrupt the service I was receiving and ask the specialist who was helping me to quickly get my part done and to run to help the white customers.

Was told by one of the servers that it was \"discouraged\" to get coffee before we sat down, so we can go get coffee down the street...in a condescending \"why are you bothering me\" tone.\n\nUm...you discourage people to buy coffee from you?\n\nLast time I went, another 1 hr wait for 2 people.  Came back 30mins later, and wanted to see how far we were on the list.  The server snatched up the list, and said \"An hour from whenever I first told you\" and walked away.\n\nNice.\n\nSo we went to Square Cafe instead in Regent Square...just as busy, just as many people...but far nicer and actually apologized for the 20min wait time.","date":"2011-04-22 02:24:43"}

This Historic land mark used to be know as the Cleveland Union Terminal and signs of its history are everywhere. \n\nThis unique center is connected to two hotels (Ritz Carlton & Renaissance) a huge casino (Horseshoe), an 11-screen movie theater, 100 shops, 6 restaurants, and  Cleveland's mass transit system. (RTA). They also have connected walkways to Progressive Field, and Quicken Loans Arena.\n\nThe Skylight Concourse is definitely something to see; this four story (+) tall atrium overlooks the Cuyahoga river hosting a food court and cinema. Here you can grab some stir-fried veggies at Sakkio Japan, Bourbon Chicken at Kelly's Cajun Grill, or just a warm pretzel from Auntie Anne's while enjoying the scenery of  downtown Cleveland and Ohio City.\n\nThe holidays at Cleveland City Center is truly a sight to see. In December they have a 40ft tall Christmas tree with larger than life hanging mechanical ornaments, Gingerbread village, and the best thing ever, the Twigbee Shop! Here you can bring kids under 12 with their shopping list for parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, and uncles and a volunteer helps the little ones buy gifts under $10 that are pre-wrapped. \n\nBesides all the cool shops, you can truly just get lost in this place and enjoy the sights and sounds. Eat, drink, shop, eat, drink, shop... How can you go wrong with that. If all else fails, go blow your shopping money at the casino.\n\nOne of my favorite amenities at City Center is the subway. Cleveland's RTA rumbles below the center giving you the feel a bustling metropolis. Here you can jump the sub and go pretty much anywhere you want in the city, and the mall resembles an oldtyme train station. Just the architecture alone draws me in, I can spend an entire day meandering the halls, people watching, sipping coffee and munching on some delicious treats.\n\nTower City Center is a safe, clean, and fun place to take the kids, watch a movie, or blow your paycheck, just remember to get your parking ticket validated.","date":"2013-10-03 13:18:24"}

Just because I feel generous. \n\nService: okay. When we walked in, a guy behind the counter just stared blankly at us and asked if it was dine-in and handed us menus and told us to sit where ever, so ok cool. It took about 10 minutes before the same guy came to us to approach us and ask for drink orders, and by this time, 2 other tables have sat. He was the only apparent server so I was trying to cut him slack (I work in the restaurant biz), but if you were the one who handed us menus and serve us...10 minutes is a stretch. He let my drink go empty twice, but partially my fault--I was thirsty. Didn't really come by and check if we needed anything, we eventually got what we needed ourselves by reaching onto the server's counter (sorry). There were about 5 tables in there around the time we went (6pm-6:30pm), so it wasn't that busy...service could've been better in my opinion. \n\nFood and Pricing: I ordered a medium bowl of pho dac biet, probably the most common pho in any pho restaurant. The portion was SMALLER than most pho restaurants I've been to, and more expensive than the other pho restaurants I've been to. It was about 10$ for a medium, and in my opinion, was NOT worth it. The broth is more on the bland side, so season well with the condiments. Probably about 6 pieces of meat in there max, so if you like a large portion of meat in your pho, don't eat here. I also ordered an order of spring rolls. They were eh, okay. They're small also compared to other restaurants, and of course, cost a little bit more than other restaurants. \n\nOverall: It was a whim coming in here, I probably won't be back because I live in Charlotte and was just in the area. If I was from the area, I'd probably try somewhere else also. The portion of the food just didn't match the price, you can find better pho elsewhere. Even if that means driving a little further. The service wasn't spectacular either to make up for the food. Pretty much to sum it up, mediocre. I'd recommend eating elsewhere!","date":"2016-12-19 08:04:45"}

The size reminds me of those school safe banana bread snacks you can get from Costco. It basically tastes like that - sweet.

The facility itself is very professional, simple and well decorated.  The rooms are very calming, clean and quiet.  The therapists themselves are very varied in their techniques and skill levels.  I have tried 5 different therapists before finally finding one who is AMAZING.  The first therapist I had was TERRIBLE and I felt like i wasted my money.  The good thing about this facility is that there are many therapists on staff so if you don't like one you then you can try another.  The other therapists were good for first timers or clients looking for a non-aggressive relaxing massage.  I enjoy high pressure deep tissue massages and I finally found an amazing therapist who I exclusively book appointments with.\n\nI had a couple of negative experiences where I got 2 eye stys immediately after my massage.  I noticed on both occasions that there was residue black eye makeup on the face towel where I lay my head.  I don't know if the face towel was reused but I also understand that mascara and eyeliner don't wash out of white towels so I just assumed that the towels were fresh at the time.  I also did not request to have them changed because I didn't want to be rude so that was my mistake and I can't prove that the towels were reused so I won't fault them for that.  \n\nIn summary, if you have signed up for a membership then take the time to really try different therapists and find the one that is right for you.

All the while the person is changing your oil, they pull other parts out of the car (air filter, etc) and ask that you get them replaced, even if they've been replaced somewhere else. When I told them I got the part fixed before, they asked \"where\" in an almost confronting manner, as if they never believed it was done. Some of the service was done by them only months prior, and they acted as if they couldn't find it within their computers. Shouldn't be that hard, if whenever I decline their service that they offer me besides the oil change, they remind me the next time that I declined them the last time. I argued with the last serviceman the last time I took my jeep in for a good 15 minutes about transmission flushes. \n\nStick to your guns while going here. If all you need is an oil+filter change, tell them that when you go there. Tell them that you are not interested in anything else, or that you do other maintenance measures yourself.

Even though it's \"raw\" it's still really tasty and filling. The BLT is pretty good too, but messy to eat--definitely not a good first date food. \n\nI think you have to keep an open mind when you go to places like this, because the rawness makes it harder to fool your average carnivore. I've seen children at nearby tables take one bite, make a face and push the plate away, whereas in places where they cook the vegan food kids will have no idea that they're not eating chicken fingers or whatever the item is. \n\nThe service here is slow. And when I say slow I mean I aged considerably while waiting for my food. I wish I could say this only happened once, but it's happened every time I've been there. I think it's because they make everything from scratch and there are only one or two people working in the restaurant at all times. If you have three or four tables, you do the math. It isn't pretty.\n\nI'm happy to have this place open as an option, but it does not get my highest recommendation.","date":"2015-08-06 20:56:05"}

Usually I brace myself for disappointment at HK diners because they're not known for their service or their quality of food, but this one made me question if I was dreaming. \n\nService was very fast and staff are friendly. They close at 10 and we were staying because the show on their tv ends at 10. We hurried to get our bill but they were like, that's ok the show isn't over, feel free to stay. Like how nice is that! \n\nDishes came promptly too, meaning that the dishes were hot when they arrived. Yay! \n\nDecor is... Well, let's just say this isn't a place you'd want to set a candle lit dinner. But I mean it's a HK diner so what were y'all expecting? \n\nOKAY SO THE FOOD. Cheap, and big portions! I love that they have enough toppings for my udon. Actually, they gave a lot and I'm so glad. Their fish in cream sauce on rice was great and very cheesy. My fav! Also, their pork and chicken chop with garlic sauce on rice qas great too. The sauce wasn't too strong. It was aromatic and delicious. \n\nBut lemme tell you about the satay chicken udon I had. Oh my goodness. So many toppings and they had strips of green and red pepper to help complicate the taste. The noodles weren't oily. You could actually taste the gusto the chef put in when he was cooking this delectable dish in his wok. Oh my gosh. Definite 5\/5.\n\nAnd then! We had free dessert! It was my fav. I have to say, this is a very unique recipe of coconut sago and I love it. This coconut sago has taro chunks and egg. The egg was the truly unique bit because it actually made the dessert feel smoother and it made the whole thing more aromatic. Usually I despise taro with every fibre of my being but not today! My mom even said this may be the only time I did not puke at taro. \n\nMy dinner was $9.50, came with a hot drink (I chose lemon water), a soup (I chose cream of veg but they also have Chinese soup), and if you're lucky, a dessert. What a deal, especially with the amount of food i got! \n\nIf you're a skeptic of HK diners like I am, please come to this place for dinner. It will change your mind. I will definitely come back.

My cravings were something fried, but also wanted some spicy soup to balance the two out. My thoughts were Tang Soo Yook and Jjampong!!! \n\nWe walked in a few minutes before closing and asked the server if she was still serving... she went back to the kitchen to see if the light was still on. If the light is on, that means the Chef can still cook for us and luckily it was!!!\n\nI enjoyed their Tang Soo Yook, which is a deep fried pork that comes with a tangy jelly-like sauce.. similar to sweet and sour that they give you on the side to pour over. This came out steamy, hot!!! Tasted fresh and love the tempura\/cornstarch batter that makes this deep fried pork so delightful to eat. The oil that was used seem new and made this dish taste light and perfectly crisp. Each bite was pipin' hot and delicious. The sauce that completes this dish consists of sliced cucumber, carrot, napa cabbage, wood ear mushrooms, and onion. I would say, without this sauce.. it would be very plain jane and definitely wouldn't be as good. Love!\n\nMy minus one star was the Jjampong. Although it had chunks of seafood, it lacked flavor tremendously. It was like putting chunks of cayenne pepper in water and heating it up. The spices didn't really do it for me and I felt like there were some missing ingredients that could have done wonders for this soup. That was the only thing that wasn't so great, but I did enjoy the texture of the noodles in this soup very much. \n\nTheir side dishes is very limited to only daikon and kimchi. But their kimchi is very notable... my Father loves the kimchi here and so do I. Small bite size square cut shaped, lightly seasoned, crisp, with a solid homemade taste. If they sold this by the jar, I would definitely buy a few :) Delicious.\n\nThis restaurant is also very known for their Jjajangmyun. A thick black soybean paste sauce with diced meat (pork) and vegetables (mainly diced onion). Normally, if you ask for Jjajangmyun, the sauce is already pre-made, but you can ask the server to cook the sauce fresh, which is called Gan Jjajang myun. If you like your vegetables cooked well, then order Jjajangmyun. If you like your vegetables semi-raw, then you will enjoy Gan Jjajang myun. I enjoy mine cooked well and so does my Mother. My Father, on the other hand orders the semi-raw. I don't think anybody knows that they can order it this way, so just sharing how my Family and I order our food choices here.\n\nThe location is somewhat hidden.. it's tucked in a corner nearby 168 market.. in between the Furniture Store and Nelson Barber Shop. Even the name of this restaurant is written in Chinese Characters, so don't look for Shan Dong!! Good service, great meal, and satisfies my cravings for Korean-Chinese cuisine.","date":"2012-04-28 09:57:50"}

Then moving into a plaza with a larger dining area.  For those of you that are not aware this is the home of the infamous Sumo Burger and Super Sumo Burger.   The names of the burger should speak for them selves but in case they don't let me sum it up for you....INSANE.  The Sumo Burger is 1 lbs of meat and the Super Sumo is 1.5 lbs of meat.  Not only are these burger massive but they taste amazing also.  Its massive and super messy and super hard to eat.  A good burger is a messy burger.  Well that's what I say at least.  I have visited C & Dubbs many times but my last visit i realized I had never reviewed it.  On my last visit of course I had the Sumo Burger but I shared the fries as the burger and a whole plate of fries would have been way to much for me.  Burger was super juicy and tasty.  Dripping with goodness.  Fries were super crispy and tasty.  Seeing as I always order the Sumo Burger when I visit C & Dubbs i think next time i'm going to step out of the box and order something else that is on their great menu.  \n\nALERT !!!!! Mississauga and Etobicoke and all surrounding areas C & Dubbs = Great charbroiled burgers.  Make sure to visit you wont be disappointed.","date":"2017-11-06 20:13:18"}

They were amazing. Unfortunately I totally forgot to take pictures. \nFriday, I went back to my old nail place because I had a gift certificate that I wanted to use up. They completely butchered my nails. I literally was in tears, because of the pain from the harder than normal grinding. Also the 20 times of being put under the light after every screw up. I knew there was no amount of fixing that would make it right, it really just kept getting worse. (And yes, I was the dummy that didn't get up and walk out. I was trying so hard to maintain composure and just hope that it turned out ok).\nSo... Sunday I went straight back here. I explained what happened and they were so very nice. Cindy was busy, so I went with Julia (I believe that was her name). She was very attentive and careful. She did a beautiful job.

My fiancé called the Casino and were told that our $35.00 parking fee would be waved for eating at the buffet. (We were only visiting for dinner). When we get down to the buffet we had to wait in line for about an hour and there were empty seats everywhere. So I decided to go up to the front to ask about how long it might take and the hostess basically ignored me and turned around and started yelling to her coworkers about how annoyed she was that \"people\" kept coming up and asking her about the wait. Long story short, we finally make it into the buffet area and were seated.  We had to wait about 10 minutes before we were even brought water. We finally got to the food only to find that it was not great. The fish was very dry. In all honesty the two things I really only enjoyed were the gumbo soup and cocktail shrimp. For the price of the buffet here and income of a casino I was expecting much higher quality food. We were also barely acknowledged by our waiter, and some of the other waiters were yelling slang to each other in the dining area. Very unprofessional. To top off our \"not so good experience\" we were told that we could not be refunded the $35.00 parking fee. But wait.. That's the only reason we parked there when we could have just payed $10 in the next parking garage. So $75 for a not so great dinner. We definitely won't be returning any time soon.

The sweet potato clam soup is also great, we've had it twice. It was better the first time but still very good. My waffles... AMAZING. I could have eaten a whole stack!

To keep this short we were lied to about personal training contracts which set off a cascade of events.  We had personal training for a year with LA.  When that expired we went to cancel our training and were told, at the time of signing, that we could use any banked sessions after canceling.  The personal training manager at the gym on Riverview (Peter) told us this was not the case and to prevent our 16 banked sessions from expiring 30 days later we could change our contract to one session per month.  We did.  After that we could never get in with our trainer.  We would show up to discover that he was working with someone else, we would schedule times with him and then they would mysteriously fall off the schedule, and we even noticed that we were being charged for sessions with other trainers that we didn't book.  We believe that Peter was filling our trainer's schedule with new clients and pushing us off since we were on our way out. When talking to Peter he was sure to inform us of his salary and that to keep his position he needs to keep his body fat under a certain percentage.\n\nI spoke with James T. (VP of Personal Training) and we worked out a deal.  We were refunded some of the sessions we had banked and could keep the balance without them expiring.  We had to take a few months off of lifting due to an injury so this was a great arrangement.\n\nWhen we went to use the sessions we were told they had expired.  I contacted James to get them back.  After four weeks and five voice messages James never called me back.  I emailed the customer service email and they eventually called me.  They only gave me 3 sessions back.  I told them this was unacceptable as we should have had 4 and that I would not allow them to just steal the session.  I then received a call from the Regional Operations Manager for Phoenix.  He agreed to refund us for the one session that was still in dispute.\n\nWe went to the gym on Stapley\/University to use our three sessions.  We were very specific about what we wanted.  All we needed at this time was help to perfect squat and deadlift form.  We were told that Joseph is the guy for that.  We scheduled a time to work with Joseph.  We showed up as scheduled and the front desk informed us that he doesn't work at that time.  We checked the schedule in the app to find out that somebody moved our appointment with Joseph from a saturday to a thursday without contacting us.  We then rescheduled a time with Joseph.\n\nWhen we met Joseph for our session he very arrogently and aggressively scolded me for asking him to only help us with form. \"That's not how training works, if you're going to work out with me I'm going to make your plan and you're going to do what I say.\"  We spoke with the manager and he told me we could either work out with Joseph or not, but that we would be charged for the session.  We were very specific when we scheduled the session that we did not want him to make a plan and that all we needed was help with our form.  \n\nI chose not to challenge this because I was tired of having to speak with people in upper management to resolve issues caused in the gym and this was the third strike for LA Fitness.  We were charged the session and we will simply allow the last two sessions to go unused rather than giving LA another opportunity to disappoint us.  We have canceled our membership and will work out at a different gym moving forward.\n\nThroughout our time at LA Fitness we have been treated as a bank for which to remove money.  The service has been terrible, we have been continually lied to, being scolded and talked down to by a person whom I paid $100 per hour to work out with was the last straw.  I will not miss LA Fitness.  \n\nMy best recommendation is to avoid LA Fitness.","date":"2018-03-15 19:27:11"}

It is the coolest thing I have ever seen on yelp. \n\nSo we got here on an afternoon to have some lunch. The restaurant just opened but there was already a party inside! The servers are really nice and really cute :o. Lol. Anyway, we wanted to get a hachapuri and some khinkali (georgian dumplings). There were no pictures on the menu, but even the photos on yelp were hard to distinguish the sizing and portion of food. Let me say upon arrival of our food I was shocked by how generous the portions were! The Khinkali dumplings each of them were like the size of a small person's fist. And the hachapuri was the size of a small pizza. Very filling indeed, even when sharing with a friend. We both loved the food. The khinkali pork and beef had some interesting spices...tasted very beefy and rich. I needed to cleanse the palate with some of their tangy dipping sauces from time to time. Their sauces are really tasty btw. They come as a complimentary appetizer with some hot buns on the side.\n\nThe food was so memorable! I would love to come back to try some other Georgian dishes.

In a nutshell, she made it as painless as possible, and we walked out extremely happy.\n\n   After my wife's car accident, I was dreading going through the process.  I don't like to feel pressured and obligated to buy from a sales person, especially in regards to something as big as a new car, and would rather bow out than give in.  However, Macon was awesome for us; she had an awesome personality, knew exactly what we wanted and didn't try to deviate from that into something else, and seemed to really help us and understand what we said we could afford when it came down to financing.\n\n   If I were to be completely honest, some of the others that had tried to help seemed to put the pressure on us when we were getting down to the nitty-gritty business of financing, and I almost backed out.  If it hadn't been for Macon and her partner in crime, Alex Woodford, it may not have happened.  Those two were so awesome, patient and understanding about how I needed time to review the information and consider everything before making the final decision.  Between my hesitation and thorough research, I ended up delaying the process for about over a week or more, but because of their patience and just awesomeness all around, we walked out with a better car than I had even expected in the end.\n\n   Again, Macon Wild is the person to see at Enterprise Car Sales in Las Vegas.

I am definitely glad that I decided to go with the Best Bang for Your Buck Groupon experience for two at Gun Garage. Not only do you get to shoot more guns at this venue it seems, but it also seems more suited to novices as well. They provide you with transportation to and from the strip. The driver was nice and very conversational. \n\nOnce we got to the gun garage all we had to do was fill out a form, show our IDs, and listen to our gun range officer and we were ready to go. Our range safety officer's name was James and he was extremely friendly and polite. He knew both of us had never shot a gun before and so he made sure he went over all of the proper steps with us more than once. Not once throughout our entire time there did we feel intimidated. He even gave us support while we were firing because we had never felt recoil before. \n\nIn all we got to shoot A LOT of guns (9 I believe), much more than with the similarly priced deals at Battlefield Vegas. Although the whole experience only lasts about 15-20 minutes per person it felt like a really long time probably because it was our first time shooting and because of all of the adrenaline pumping. I definitely want to go back and shoot my favorite guns with more clips since I now know which ones I like. All in all though this is definitely the perfect venue for people who have never held a gun in their hands before.","date":"2017-06-17 19:08:43"}

I mean the menu is by no means healthy. It is called FATburger- due to the quantity of food and the calories associated with that food.

Pump up your AC! Especially since your kitchen shares the bar & dining room and the majority of your dishes are HOT, never mind your clientele. ;-)\n\n2 of the 3 stars go to:\n\n1) Jarod: the epitome of a composed and well-conducted host. If you look up \"host\" in the dictionary, Jarod's picture should be displayed. He was bombarded every minute from our arrival to when we were eventually seated. He was calm, collected and extremely pleasant. The best part, when he came to fetch us at Central Wine he said, \"Your table is ready. Don't rush. You waited for us. We will wait for you.\" *Phenomenal* \n\n2) Courteous Wait Staff: at no point did we receive any attitude to our hungry and impatient (did I mention over-heated?) dispositions. Instead, we were comped and sweetened with desert and smiles.\n\nThe 2 hour wait to be served a semblance of food & beverage from check-in to seating is absurd. We arrived at 7:20 and were told a couple tables had bills and should be cleared \"shortly\". A stuffy 30 min later we informed our patient host that we would be at Central Wine (a fantastically COOL waiting area). Once we were seated (around 8:20) we were greeted, a beverage and app order taken - both were served together about 12 min later. Thank goodness we had water refilled. Seriously, it had to be 81 degrees in the dining room. We ordered our entrees right away.\n\nI have to say the \"special\" was quite tasty: salmon sashimi, seaweed, carrots, mandarin oranges and I believe some small grapefruit over brown rice. There was no way I was going to handle a steaming plate\/bowl of anything in that heat. My husband was disappointed at the amount of duck in his Massaman Curry. The noodles far outweighed the 5, possibly 6, thinly sliced pieces of duck. And he was generous to share a piece with me, but once I saw how little he had I felt bad and offered it back. I tasted a bit and it tantalized the tastebuds but left much to desire ... more duck!\n\nPerhaps Friday night is not the time to dine at Clever Koi. I would like to give it another chance, as this kind of pleasant service is hard to find anymore. I think I'll wait until October or November to tantalize my longing for their Spicy Seafood Hot Pot. Right now, I cringe at the thought of nose-planting from the heat into the spicy lava of tentacles.","date":"2014-07-28 01:27:02"}

However, the bartenders and waitress we had were both excellent, checking up on us often and refilling our waters.

If you sit on the right side, Tomo shares an adjacent wall with a noisy night club, and your table will thump with hip-hop music. This obviously isn't their fault for having noisy neighbors, but it can definitely hinder a first date or good conversation.\n\nThis also goes for choosing when to eat there. I recommend Friday night, before the bar crowds start rolling into the neighborhood. You'll find better parking, and it will be a quieter experience. As for the food, the sushi at Tomo is quality for the prices, but be prepared to spend a little more than usual. The presentation is beautiful, and the service is fast considering their busy Warehouse District location. I absolutely love the Indian Roll and the Sexy Girl roll, and I must mention how nice it is to have a hibachi downtown. The sushi is worthy of a visit, but if you don't have time to sit down, they will never fail you on takeout.","date":"2016-03-06 23:43:57"}

Walk in and an employee will hand you a handy, dandy card which you use to swipe and accumulate expenses at various food stations (pasta, salad, antipasto, pizza, bar, dessert). It's convenient and not too crowded. Apparently the pasta is made fresh daily and they actually cook the dish in front of you--note, this significantly increases your wait time. \n\nI ordered the Pasta Vongole (one of the specials listed in front of the pasta station - $9.95). It was supposed to have white wine, clams, garlic, capers, and anchovies. However, upon closer inspection, my capers and anchovies must have vanished in thin air. The pasta is good, but the dish as a whole lacked flavor. LIke past reviewers, I also found my pasta dry (however, one of my friends had pasta that looked like it was sauced in soup). Serving sizes are huge though (considering how filling pasta can be). My friend who got the carbonara said the sauce was much too heavy but he really enjoyed his side caesar salad. \"The anchovy flavor was great.\" I also got the trio of bruschetta ($4.50) and white chocolate mousse ($2.75) to go. \n\nFinally, I had some issues with the card they provided in that it charged me almost $10 more than it should have when I went to check out. Fortunately, the cashiers were understanding and removed the mysteriously appearing dishes from my check. Overall, I would give this place a second chance since the fresh-made pasta actually has a great texture and the employees are friendly. It's also a great alternative to fast food and traditional sit-down restaurants.","date":"2012-06-26 02:43:12"}

Unfortunately, the food and service were awful.  We will not be back.  \n\nWhen we arrived at around 9:30 on a Saturday morning, the restaurant was not crowded.  Even so, the service was very slow.  There seemed to be one waiter and one busboy on duty.  The waiter seated us and then vanished.  My husband finally went over to the coffee station, brought the pot  to our table and filled our empty cups.  The coffee was fair -- not great.  We eventually saw the waiter, at the back of the room talking on his cell phone.  After a wait of nearly half an hour, we were getting up to leave.  The busboy suddenly appeared and took our order.\n\nOur meal arrived quickly.  The busboy who brought our food dropped the containers of jam onto the floor, picked them up, stacked them back in their little holder and put them onto our table.  Needless to say, we skipped the jam.  We asked repeatedly for butter for our toast & biscuit, and finally my husband headed for the kitchen to find some.  He was intercepted by the busboy, who brought butter.  By this time, our toast & biscuit were stone cold.\n\nMy veggie omelet was so greasy that I couldn't eat it.  My biscuit was obviously a pre-packaged item, which had been split and toasted on the grill in an apparent effort to make it seem fresh.\n\nMy husband's scrambled eggs and sausage were OK -- nothing special.  The bacon strips were curled up in little balls ... apparently no one in the kitchen knows how to cook bacon.  The sliced tomato was good.\n\nThe menu is enormous.  Based on our experience this morning, I would guess that most of the food is precooked, prepackaged and just heated in the microwave or otherwise warmed for service.  Icky!\n\nIf you want a delicious, fresh breakfast in Fountain Hills, our best recommendations are Sofrita on Avenue of the Fountains (great coffee, interesting fresh food, creative decor) or EuroPizza Cafe on Saguaro in Lakeside Plaza (good coffee, good fresh food, lovely view of the lake and fountain).  For bagels, try DJs on Palisades in the Safeway center.  We would suggest steering clear of Kimmie's.","date":"2013-07-13 19:19:14"}

Where Treasure Island had horrible service and crappy rooms, Flamingo came in with wonderful customer service and a wonderful room. My room was clean, comfortable and neat. Every person working there greeted me with a smile. And the biggest plus of all? The Flamingo let me bring my dog and let me walk her anywhere except for the casino and pool area.

Having spent nearly 5 years with metal train-track braces until the age of 17, I have an aversion for dentists and have not seen one in 20+ years.  I also have only owned this phone number for 4 years.  Therefore, I am confident you will not find my name or birth date within your records.   Yes, I still have all my teeth and the money my parents spent every month over those long 5 years has not gone to waste.  With my repeated requests (including twice in the last two days) to remove my phone number from Western Dental records and now that I have blocked 602-258-2371 from my phone, I do not expect to receive calls from Western Dental.  If Western Dental chooses to call from a different phone number, rather than following through with removing my phone number as promised, then I will be glad to update this post again with those calls.","date":"2017-09-20 18:39:03"}

The serving size was HUGE for me, especially knowing I was going out later...big meals kinda make me wanna zzzzzzzz... anyways. Yum. The place is really good. The only negative, and this just my personal preference, was that it was very noisy. So if you are looking for a quiet, romantic spot for dinner? This isn't it.

I was wary at the $7 price, but the mix of dark chocolate, cinnamon and red chili was too intriguing to pass up. It pretty much rocked my world. So I did some research and discovered that there was a shop in Vegas, and wouldn't you know.. I had a trip planned already for Spring Break! \n\nVisiting the shop was the only thing on my itinerary for that weekend, and when I finally was able to drag my bro and sis there, we were in heaven. I walked off with a bagful of bars and some toffee, plus a few gifts for friends. At least 2 flavors are available for samples on the counter, but more importantly you can sample almost everything with the assistance of the staff. After my lengthy visit, I had sampled more than half of the options I think! What a great chocolate coma I had the rest of the day.  \n\nBesides the great product, what I was really impressed with was the friendly staff. I got a lot of great information and tips from the woman who helped me, and she was more than happy to give me and my family plenty of samples and suggestions. Those of you that read my reviews know how much I appreciate great service like this. And as a little epilogue, the other day I received a letter in the mail from the shop, which contained a hand-written note thanking me for my patronage and included a coupon for store and online use.  I can't wait to use it soon!","date":"2009-05-22 02:14:26"}

Our first reservation choice wasn't Sunday but it was the only time we could get in. This was my first visit to Chima and my boyfriend's second visit. We arrived right at 7:30 and waited about 10 minutes before our table was ready. The restaurant was pretty easy to find and valet parking was complimentary.  We ate upstairs which I understand is less crowded than the downstairs dining area.\n\nThe restaurant was right downtown Charlotte and the decor was modern, sleek and warm. First portion of the three-course meal was the salad bar, which in my opinion is enough for a meal. I don't know if they offer that alone but it might be a good idea if they ever decide to open for lunch. It also might be appealing to those of us who can't justify spending fifty bucks there outside of restaurant week since the meal is just way too much for the average person to eat in my opinion.\n\nThe salad bar was very decadent and consisted of beef carpaccio, caprese salad, shrimp salad, a nice variety of greens, melon, soy beans, chicken salad, waldorf salad and few others items. There was also a wide variety of dressings, sauces for your meats, a couple different types of rice, three or four different soups, and bread with butter. \n\nAfter visiting the salad bar you sit down and the men come by with a variety of meats. My favorite was by far the top sirloin; second favorite was the parmesan pork tenderloin. It was pretty salty but still good. I also had the filet mignon wrapped with bacon but it was pretty fatty for a filet. I also enjoyed the flank steak and chicken. My boyfriend really enjoyed the ribs. I also had the swordfish, which I found to be a bit dry, and the lamb, which was too gamy for my liking. While we were being served the meats we had other side items being served to us. I forgot to mention the appetizer, which were doughy Parmesan rolls with a turkey dip, very good. The side items were fried bananas and some fried potato sticks, which tasted like hash browns. I personally didn't care for the fried bananas but I don't like bananas much anyway.\n\nBelieve it or not we ordered dessert. It didn't come with the meal but I wanted a little something sweet. So we ordered the crème brulee. It stole the show. We finished that off in about five minutes. Maybe the best crème brulee I have ever had. \n\nService was very good and I was pleased. I enjoyed the experience but I wouldn't go back for myself. It's just way too much food and I would rather savor one entree instead of be constantly paraded with more food while I am trying to eat what I have. I would love to go back just for the salad bar and dessert though. They had a lot of other choices for dessert as well. They don't give boxes for your leftovers either so eat up!","date":"2012-02-01 04:09:56"}

I dined at two restaurants and this was one of them.\n\nThe place was rather empty, but that's because it was Halloween evening.\n\nWith that being said, the interior design is pretty cool but feels a bit cold. I had a couple of things on the menu. I had the halibut as my main dish and the california roll just for fun. I was very stuffed by the end of the evening. I liked both dishes.\n\nI think Ko Fusion needs to focus on one cuisine. It's trying to be everything to everyone. But what I had was tasty. The outside signage says 'Steak Pizza Sushi Seafood.'
